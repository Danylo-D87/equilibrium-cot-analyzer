COT Data Limitations: What It Can't Tell You
Feb 17, 2026
COT Analysis
The COT report is a legitimate and widely used tool for understanding futures market positioning. It is also frequently misused — applied to questions it was never designed to answer.
Before relying on COT data in any analysis, it helps to be clear about what the report does not contain.
What the COT Report Is
As a baseline: the COT report tells you how large futures market participants are positioned, relative to history.
That is a specific and useful piece of information. It does not extend much beyond that without additional analysis and context.
Limitation 1: It Does Not Tell You Why
The COT report records position size and direction. It does not explain the reason behind any position.
A large speculative long in crude oil could mean:
1 A macro fund is betting on supply tightening
2 An ETF rebalance is mechanically adding exposure
3 A hedge fund is offsetting a short position elsewhere
4 A passive commodity index is rolling its standard allocation
All of these would appear identically in the legacy report. The disaggregated format improves this slightly by separating managed money from swap dealers, but even then, the reasoning behind positions is unknown.
This matters because the signal value of a position depends on motivation. An index fund mechanically buying has no directional view. Treating its position as a sentiment signal is a mistake.
Limitation 2: It Does Not Time Reversals
Extreme COT readings flag when positioning is historically stretched. They do not indicate when — or whether — a reversal will happen.
A market at the 97th percentile can reach the 99th. It can stay above the 95th percentile for 20 consecutive weeks before unwinding. The extreme reading tells you the trade is crowded; it tells you nothing about the catalyst or timing of an exit.
Analysts who use COT data as a standalone short signal at extreme readings will find that the timing variance is large enough to make the approach inconsistent. The data is more useful as a filter than a trigger.
Limitation 3: It Has No Short-Term Relevance
COT data is collected on Tuesday and published the following Friday. By the time it is public, it is already 3 days old.
For any analysis involving moves within the week, the data is simply irrelevant. A significant news event on Wednesday can shift positioning dramatically before the next report captures it.
Even at a weekly cadence, the data is better suited to identifying multi-week or multi-month positioning trends rather than near-term price moves.
Limitation 4: It Does Not Capture All Participants
The non-reportable category is a residual. It contains every trader whose position is below the CFTC's reporting threshold — which includes retail traders, small funds, and others.
These participants are invisible in the data except as an aggregate. Their individual strategies, sizes, and motivations are unknown.
More importantly, the reporting thresholds vary by market and are not always publicly specified. The boundary between what is and is not visible changes over time as the CFTC adjusts thresholds.
Limitation 5: Real-Time Positioning Is Unknown
The published report is a snapshot from Tuesday. Between Tuesday and the following Friday publication, three full trading days pass.
In volatile markets, positions can shift significantly in that window. A hedge fund that was heavily long on Tuesday may have reduced its exposure substantially by Thursday. The report would still show the Tuesday position.
This lag is not unique to COT data — most public reporting has a lag. But it is worth remembering when the data is discussed as if it reflects current market conditions.
Limitation 6: It Contains No Price Information
The COT report records contracts, not prices. It tells you how many net long or short contracts are held — not where traders entered, what their stop levels are, or where they expect the market to go.
Statements like "speculators are long from these levels" or "commercials expect prices to fall to X" cannot be derived from COT data. The report does not contain any of that information.
This is a common source of overreach in COT commentary. The data supports statements about positioning magnitude and direction relative to history. Price targets or entry levels require separate analysis.
What COT Data Is Actually Good For
With those limitations clear, the data remains genuinely useful for:
1 Identifying historically stretched positioning — the core use case
2 Confirming or contradicting price trends — are speculators aligned with the move, or fighting it?
3 Comparing markets — which markets have the most extreme positioning simultaneously?
4 Monitoring unwinding — is a crowded position starting to reduce?
5 Risk management context — should you size down because you're trading with an already-crowded consensus?
These are medium-to-long-term applications. They work best alongside other analysis, not as the sole basis for a decision.
How the Dashboard Addresses Some Limitations
The percentile ranking approach at cotdashboard.com mitigates some (not all) of these constraints.
Using a 104-week rolling window normalises positioning across markets with very different absolute contract sizes. A raw contract number for gold is meaningless without context — the percentile rank provides that context automatically.
The weekly update cadence means the lag is always visible — every reading is explicitly dated, so there is no ambiguity about when the data was collected.
What percentile ranks cannot fix: the why, the timing, the real-time gap, and the absence of price information. Those limitations are structural to the report itself.

Market Data
COT Positioning Report: Week of February 3, 2026
Weekly positioning snapshot for educational purposes. Not financial advice.
Executive Summary
The data shows substantial positioning changes across fixed income markets this week, with Treasury contracts registering the largest absolute adjustments. Large speculators reduced net short positions across the entire yield curve, led by 2-Year Treasury contracts declining 10.55% to -1,347,602 contracts and 30-Year Treasury positions contracting 66.57% to -13,604 contracts. Currency markets displayed divergent behavior, with Australian Dollar positioning increasing 265.49% to net long 26,118 contracts. This establishes the baseline for future tracking of speculative positioning across 41 futures markets.
Top 5 Weekly Position Changes
The largest percentage changes this week occurred across diverse asset classes:
Australian Dollar posted the week's largest percentage shift at +265.49%, bringing net positioning to 26,118 contracts. This represents a substantial rotation toward net long exposure in currency markets.
30-Year Treasury positioning contracted 66.57% to -13,604 contracts, marking the most significant percentage reduction in the bond complex despite representing a smaller absolute position size.
Brazilian Real increased 64.3% to net long 30,962 contracts, contributing to broader strength in emerging market currency positioning.
Nasdaq 100 declined 58.21% to net long 12,068 contracts, representing the sharpest positioning reduction among equity indices.
Coffee C decreased 43.9% to net long 18,364 contracts, registering the largest percentage change within agricultural commodities tracked this week.
Absolute Position Analysis
Largest Net Long Positions:
The data reveals Gold maintaining the largest net long position at 165,604 contracts, representing the most concentrated bullish speculative exposure across all markets tracked. Euro FX follows with net long positioning of 163,361 contracts, indicating substantial long exposure in major currency markets. Crude Oil WTI holds net long 124,565 contracts, marking the energy sector's largest absolute position.
Largest Net Short Positions:
Treasury markets dominate net short positioning in absolute terms. 5-Year Treasury holds the largest net short position at -2,158,980 contracts, representing the most significant concentration of bearish exposure across all tracked markets. 2-Year Treasury shows net short positioning of -1,347,602 contracts, while 10-Year Treasury registers -729,414 contracts. This concentration reveals large speculators maintaining substantial short exposure across the intermediate portion of the yield curve.
Category Breakdown
Fixed Income Markets:
The Treasury complex shows coordinated short positioning across all maturities tracked. The 5-Year maturity holds the largest absolute short position at -2,158,980 contracts, followed by 2-Year at -1,347,602 contracts. All three maturities registered positioning reductions this week, with percentage changes ranging from -0.45% (10Y) to -66.57% (30Y). This pattern indicates large speculators reducing existing short exposure while maintaining overall net short positioning structure.
Currency Markets:
Foreign exchange positioning displays mixed characteristics across the six markets tracked. Australian Dollar (26,118 contracts), Brazilian Real (30,962 contracts), and Euro FX (163,361 contracts) show net long positioning. British Pound registers net short positioning at -13,911 contracts. The divergence between developed and emerging market currencies represents the most notable cross-sectional pattern within FX markets.
Metals Complex:
All three metals tracked show net long positioning: Gold (165,604 contracts), Copper (47,814 contracts), and Platinum (13,106 contracts). Gold's absolute position exceeds copper by 3.5:1 ratio, indicating concentrated positioning preference toward precious metals over industrial metals.
Energy Sector:
Energy markets display uniformly net long positioning: Crude Oil WTI leads at 124,565 contracts, followed by Gasoline RBOB at 76,431 contracts and Ethanol at 5,585 contracts. The crude oil position represents 2.2 times the combined positioning of refined products tracked.
Equity Indices:
Index markets show universally net long positioning but registered substantial weekly contractions. Nasdaq 100 holds 12,068 contracts, Russell 2000 shows 4,298 contracts, and Dow Jones maintains 1,047 contracts. All three indices declined between 8.48% and 65.13% this week, representing coordinated positioning reduction across equity derivatives.
Agricultural Commodities:
Grain markets display mixed positioning: Coffee C shows net long 18,364 contracts, while Corn registers net short -34,698 contracts and Cocoa shows net short -14,508 contracts.
Digital Assets:
Cryptocurrency futures show divergent positioning: Bitcoin holds net long 1,008 contracts while Micro Ethereum registers net short -3,196 contracts.
Cross-Sectional Market Insights
Cross-market comparison reveals several positioning patterns. The Treasury complex shows the most concentrated absolute positioning across all asset classes, with combined net short exposure exceeding 4.2 million contracts across three maturities. This concentration substantially outweighs positioning in any other sector tracked.
Currency markets split evenly between net long and net short positioning, with no dominant directional bias. Energy sector net long positioning (206,581 contracts combined) represents approximately 1.25 times the total metals complex positioning (226,524 contracts combined).
Of 41 markets tracked, 24 show net long positioning while 17 register net short positioning, indicating slight aggregate bias toward long exposure across large speculator categories.
Data Context Note
This report establishes the baseline measurement for ongoing COT positioning analysis. With limited historical data currently available, this analysis focuses on cross-sectional comparisons across markets rather than time-series trends. Future reports will incorporate historical context as the database builds sufficient observations for meaningful trend analysis. The current snapshot provides the foundational reference point for tracking subsequent positioning changes and developing pattern recognition across speculative positioning behavior.

COT Report Analysis (Feb 10, 2026) – FX Positioning Extremes, Soft Commodity Capitulation & Treasury Weakness – Free Weekly COT Data
Feb 10, 2026
Market Data Analysis
Executive Summary
Last week's analysis showed building pressure in currency markets and continued precious metals weakness. This week delivered confirmation: three major currencies—Australian Dollar (99th percentile), Canadian Dollar (99th percentile), and Euro FX (99th percentile)—simultaneously reached near 2-year highs in net long positioning. Meanwhile, soft commodities capitulated to extreme net short territory, with Cocoa, Coffee C, and Sugar #11 all at the 1st percentile, and precious metals remained pinned near their lows with Gold (3rd percentile) and Silver (3rd percentile).

What Stood Out This Week
This week's standout finding was the synchronized extreme net long positioning across major G10 currencies. We observed three currencies simultaneously at the 99th percentile—a rare confluence that suggests coordinated dollar weakness positioning by large speculators. The Australian Dollar reached 33,209 contracts (Z-score: 2.10), sitting 81,080 contracts above its 105-week average, while Canadian Dollar positioning at 13,276 contracts showed an even more dramatic deviation (Z-score: 2.35), standing 118,650 contracts above its historical mean. This represents among the most concentrated anti-dollar bets in the past two years across multiple currency pairs.
Top 10 Extreme Positions
The following table shows the 10 most extreme positions relative to their 105-week history:
Rank Market Net Position Percentile Z-Score 1 Cocoa -18,946 1st -2.52 2 Canadian Dollar 13,276 99th 2.35 3 Coffee C 13,931 1st -2.30 4 Sugar #11 -235,401 1st -2.29 5 Silver 22,955 3rd -2.25 6 Australian Dollar 33,209 99th 2.10 7 Gasoline RBOB 89,956 96th 1.99 8 Euro FX 180,305 99th 1.88 9 Natural Gas -171,865 4th -1.84 10 Gold 160,012 3rd -1.79
Extreme Positions Deep Dive
Foreign Exchange: Coordinated Dollar Weakness
The FX complex delivered the week's clearest narrative. Three major currencies reached the 99th percentile simultaneously: Australian Dollar at 33,209 contracts, Canadian Dollar at 13,276 contracts, and Euro FX at 180,305 contracts. The Euro position represents a 125,542-contract deviation above its 105-week average, while the Canadian Dollar's Z-score of 2.35 indicates this is among the most extreme net long positions in the entire dataset.
What makes this particularly notable is the breadth. The Australian Dollar gained 117,368 contracts versus its 4-week average and 122,970 contracts versus its 13-week average, suggesting recent acceleration rather than gradual accumulation. These positions reflect large speculator conviction that the dollar will weaken across commodity, European, and North American currency pairs.
Soft Commodities: Capitulation Territory
The soft commodity complex showed the opposite extreme—widespread capitulation to extreme net short positions. Cocoa reached -18,946 contracts (1st percentile, Z-score: -2.52), sitting 40,444 contracts below its historical average. Coffee C at 13,931 contracts hit the 1st percentile with a Z-score of -2.30, down 37,463 contracts from its 105-week mean. Sugar #11 delivered the largest absolute extreme net short at -235,401 contracts (1st percentile, Z-score: -2.29).
This represents a complete reversal from earlier positioning in these markets. The simultaneous extreme net short positioning across three major soft commodities suggests systematic liquidation by large speculators rather than market-specific factors.
Precious Metals: Persistent Weakness
Gold and Silver remained anchored near 2-year lows. Gold at 160,012 contracts sat at the 3rd percentile (Z-score: -1.79), down 72,012 contracts from its 105-week average. Silver at 22,955 contracts showed even more pronounced weakness at the 3rd percentile with a Z-score of -2.25, standing 25,023 contracts below its historical mean.
The persistence of these extreme net long levels (though low relative to history) contrasts sharply with the precious metals' traditional role as dollar hedges. With FX markets showing extreme net long positions against the dollar, the lack of corresponding gold strength presents a positioning puzzle.
Energy: Mixed Signals
Energy markets showed divergence. Gasoline RBOB reached the 96th percentile at 89,956 contracts (Z-score: 1.99), sitting 39,776 contracts above its 105-week average. Natural Gas moved in the opposite direction, reaching -171,865 contracts at the 4th percentile (Z-score: -1.84), down 54,826 contracts from its historical mean. Crude Oil WTI remained relatively subdued at 117,814 contracts (24th percentile), suggesting large speculators lack conviction in the crude complex despite refined product strength.
Top Weekly Changes
The Treasury complex dominated the largest absolute position changes this week, though none reached percentile extremes. The 5Y Treasury saw the largest shift at -2,114,764 contracts, sitting 869,085 contracts below its 4-week average and 904,451 contracts below its 13-week average. This placed it at the 40th percentile—neutral territory relative to history despite the large absolute size.
The 2Y Treasury at -1,289,687 contracts showed similar dynamics, sitting 292,037 contracts below its 4-week average and landing at the 28th percentile. The 10Y Treasury reached -813,027 contracts (44th percentile), down 135,164 contracts from its 4-week average.
These changes reflect systematic reduction in net short Treasury positions by large speculators, though the absolute levels remain elevated. The 30Y Treasury provided the counterpoint, reaching -92 contracts at the 89th percentile—essentially neutral positioning after unwinding previous shorts.
Among currencies, the Australian Dollar's move to 33,209 contracts represented a gain of 117,368 contracts versus its 4-week average—the largest relative currency shift of the week and sufficient to push it to the 99th percentile.
Category Breakdown
FX (9 markets)
Currency positioning showed the most extreme readings of any asset class this week. Three markets reached the 99th percentile: Australian Dollar (33,209 contracts), Canadian Dollar (13,276 contracts), and Euro FX (180,305 contracts). This represents synchronized net long positioning against the dollar across commodity, North American, and European currencies.
The remaining six currency markets showed more subdued positioning. British Pound at -25,810 contracts sat at the 18th percentile, representing a net short position. Japanese Yen reached -19,106 contracts (35th percentile), while Swiss Franc at -42,259 contracts landed at the 15th percentile. Mexican Peso (84,951 contracts, 68th percentile) and Brazilian Real (31,643 contracts, 66th percentile) showed moderate net long positions. New Zealand Dollar at -34,919 contracts (32nd percentile) diverged from its Australian counterpart with a net short position.
Metals (4 markets)
The metals complex split between industrial and precious. Copper at 45,873 contracts reached the 73rd percentile, sitting 13,384 contracts above its 105-week average (Z-score: 0.72). Platinum at 12,084 contracts showed modest positioning at the 20th percentile.
Gold and Silver remained at extreme lows. Gold's 160,012 contracts placed it at the 3rd percentile, down 72,012 contracts from its historical average. Silver at 22,955 contracts also hit the 3rd percentile, down 25,023 contracts from its 105-week mean. These represent among the lowest net long positions in the past two years for both precious metals.
Energy (5 markets)
Energy markets showed divergence between refined products and underlying commodities. Gasoline RBOB reached 89,956 contracts at the 96th percentile, up 39,776 contracts from its 105-week average (Z-score: 1.99). Heating Oil at 19,452 contracts sat at the 81st percentile. Ethanol showed moderate positioning at 6,970 contracts (74th percentile).
Natural Gas provided the opposite extreme at -171,865 contracts (4th percentile), down 54,826 contracts from its historical average (Z-score: -1.84). Crude Oil WTI at 117,814 contracts remained subdued at the 24th percentile, down 60,057 contracts from its 105-week mean.
Grains (12 markets)
The grain complex showed the widest dispersion of any category. Three soft commodities hit the 1st percentile: Cocoa (-18,946 contracts), Coffee C (13,931 contracts), and Sugar #11 (-235,401 contracts). All three showed extreme net short or extremely low net long positions relative to their 105-week histories.
Soybeans provided the counterpoint at 146,334 contracts (91st percentile), up 164,341 contracts from its historical average (Z-score: 1.48). Lean Hogs reached 82,895 contracts at the 85th percentile, while Soybean Oil at 53,277 contracts hit the 75th percentile.
The remaining grain markets clustered around neutral territory: Corn (-18,330 contracts, 56th percentile), Wheat HRW (-19,953 contracts, 59th percentile), Wheat SRW (-71,258 contracts, 39th percentile), Soybean Meal (11,372 contracts, 65th percentile), Feeder Cattle (8,881 contracts, 50th percentile), and Live Cattle (85,756 contracts, 47th percentile).
Index (5 markets)
Equity index positioning remained compressed near historical midpoints. S&P 500 at -100,714 contracts sat at the 38th percentile, down 20,697 contracts from its 105-week average. Nasdaq 100 reached 12,642 contracts at the 38th percentile, while Dow Jones at 1,433 contracts landed at the 40th percentile.
Russell 2000 provided the exception at 7,061 contracts (89th percentile), up 32,524 contracts from its historical mean. VIX futures positioning at -65,088 contracts reached the 27th percentile, down 20,248 contracts from its 105-week average.
Bonds (4 markets)
Treasury positioning showed large absolute changes but moderate percentile rankings. The 5Y Treasury at -2,114,764 contracts sat at the 40th percentile despite being down 869,085 contracts from its 4-week average. The 2Y Treasury reached -1,289,687 contracts at the 28th percentile, while the 10Y Treasury at -813,027 contracts landed at the 44th percentile.
The 30Y Treasury diverged at -92 contracts (89th percentile), essentially neutral after unwinding previous net short positions. This positioned it 44,065 contracts above its 105-week average.
Crypto (2 markets)
Bitcoin at 1,017 contracts reached the 93rd percentile, up 1,573 contracts from its historical average (Z-score: 1.57). Micro Ethereum at -3,677 contracts sat at the 22nd percentile, down 1,218 contracts from its 105-week mean.
Historical Context
Z-scores provide perspective on how unusual current positions are relative to their historical distributions. Canadian Dollar's Z-score of 2.35 indicates the current net long position sits more than two standard deviations above its mean—a statistically rare event that occurs roughly 1% of the time in a normal distribution.
Cocoa's Z-score of -2.52 shows even more extreme deviation on the net short side. This represents among the most extreme net short positions in the 105-week dataset for this market. Coffee C (Z-score: -2.30) and Sugar #11 (Z-score: -2.29) showed similar extremes.
The 13-week moving averages reveal acceleration patterns. Australian Dollar positioned 122,970 contracts above its 13-week average suggests recent building rather than sustained positioning. Similarly, the 5Y Treasury positioned 904,451 contracts below its 13-week average indicates systematic reduction in net short Treasury bets by large speculators.
Comparing current readings to the full 105-week distribution shows we're observing multiple 2-standard-deviation events simultaneously—a relatively rare occurrence that suggests either coordinated macro positioning or systematic factor exposure across large speculators.

Will the synchronized extreme net long currency positioning across Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Euro FX continue expanding, or has large speculator positioning reached saturation levels that precede reversal? With all three markets at the 99th percentile, there's limited historical room for further expansion.
Can Gold and Silver remain pinned at the 3rd percentile while FX markets show extreme dollar weakness? This divergence between traditional dollar hedges presents a positioning puzzle—either precious metals will eventually follow currencies higher, or currency positioning will prove premature.
Will soft commodity capitulation (Cocoa, Coffee, Sugar all at 1st percentile) mark a bottoming process, or does the synchronized extreme net short positioning indicate large speculators expect further fundamental deterioration? Historical 1st percentile readings have preceded both reversals and extended trends.
Does the Treasury complex's move toward neutral territory (30Y at 89th percentile, others at 28th-44th) signal large speculators are reducing their rate view conviction, or does this represent tactical repositioning ahead of further moves?
Educational Notes
The Commitment of Traders (COT) report tracks weekly positioning by different trader categories in U.S. futures markets. This analysis focuses on Non-Commercial traders—large speculators including hedge funds, asset managers, and institutional accounts—whose positioning often reflects macro views and risk sentiment.
Percentile rankings show where current positioning sits relative to the past 105 weeks (roughly two years). A 99th percentile reading means the current net position is higher than 99% of all weekly readings in that period—indicating an extreme net long position. Conversely, a 1st percentile reading indicates an extreme net short position or extremely low net long position relative to history.
Z-scores measure how many standard deviations the current position sits from its historical mean. Readings above +2 or below -2 are considered statistically unusual and occur roughly 5% of the time in normal distributions.

COT Report Analysis (Feb 17, 2026) – Currency Positioning Hits Multi-Year Highs, Precious Metals & Softs Near Lows – Free Weekly COT Data
Feb 17, 2026
Market Data Analysis
Executive Summary
Last week's analysis showed emerging strength in select currencies. This week, that trend accelerated dramatically. Currency markets dominated the extremes list, with Australian Dollar (99th percentile, net 45,931 contracts), Canadian Dollar (99th percentile, net 25,826), and Euro FX (99th percentile, net 174,480) all reaching near 2-year positioning highs. Meanwhile, precious metals showed continued weakness with Gold at the 2nd percentile (net 159,915) and Silver at the 4th percentile (net 24,003), joined by soft commodities Coffee (1st percentile), Sugar (1st percentile), and Natural Gas (1st percentile) in historically extreme net short territory.

What Stood Out This Week
This week's standout finding was the coordinated extreme net long positioning across major currency pairs, with three FX markets simultaneously reaching the 99th percentile — a configuration we observe only rarely in the 105-week dataset. Australian Dollar advanced 130,090 contracts above its 4-week average to reach 45,931 net long (Z-score: 2.41), while Canadian Dollar showed even more pronounced deviation at 25,826 contracts (Z-score: 2.58). The synchronization suggests broad portfolio reallocation toward these currencies, with all three showing gains exceeding 119,000 contracts versus their 105-week historical means.
📊 Top 10 Most Extreme Positions
The following table shows the 10 most extreme positions relative to their 105-week history:
Rank Market Net Position Percentile Z-Score 1 Australian Dollar 45,931 99th 2.41 2 Bitcoin 1,638 99th 2.16 3 Canadian Dollar 25,826 99th 2.58 4 Coffee C 12,860 1st -2.36 5 Euro FX 174,480 99th 1.79 6 Natural Gas -185,812 1st -2.29 7 Sugar #11 -253,592 1st -2.46 8 Cocoa -17,618 2nd -2.44 9 Gold 159,915 2nd -1.80 10 Silver 24,003 4th -2.16
Extreme Positions Deep Dive
FX Markets: Extreme Net Long Concentration
Currency positioning presents the most pronounced extremes this week. Australian Dollar's 99th percentile reading represents a deviation of 93,681 contracts above its 105-week average — among the largest sustained net long positions we've observed in this market. The position expanded 130,090 contracts beyond the 4-week moving average and 135,692 contracts above the 13-week baseline. Canadian Dollar showed similarly extreme characteristics with a Z-score of 2.58, indicating positioning more than 2.5 standard deviations above historical norms.
Euro FX completed the currency triumvirate at 174,480 net long contracts (99th percentile). While the Z-score of 1.79 was somewhat lower than AUD and CAD, the absolute magnitude remains substantial — 119,772 contracts above the full-period average. Bitcoin also reached the 99th percentile at 1,638 net long contracts (Z-score: 2.16), marking one of the highest crypto positioning readings in the available dataset.
Precious Metals: Persistent Net Short Positioning
Gold and Silver occupied opposite extremes. Gold's net position of 159,915 contracts sits at the 2nd percentile — 72,108 contracts below its 105-week mean with a Z-score of -1.80. This represents among the lowest net long positioning we've tracked over the past two years. Silver showed even more pronounced weakness at 24,003 contracts (4th percentile, Z-score: -2.16), sitting 23,985 contracts below its historical average. The coordination between these two metals suggests systematic positioning rather than market-specific factors.
Soft Commodities: Historic Net Short Extremes
The softs complex showed the most extreme net short readings. Sugar #11 reached the 1st percentile at -253,592 contracts, representing a deviation of -239,573 contracts from the 105-week mean (Z-score: -2.46). Coffee C similarly hit the 1st percentile at net 12,860 contracts, but this reflects extreme net long positioning at -38,523 contracts below its historical average (Z-score: -2.36). Cocoa rounded out the complex at the 2nd percentile with -17,618 net contracts (Z-score: -2.44).
Energy: Natural Gas Outlier
Natural Gas dominated energy extremes at -185,812 contracts (1st percentile), sitting 68,640 contracts below its 105-week average with a Z-score of -2.29. This contrasted sharply with Gasoline RBOB, which reached the 95th percentile at 88,742 contracts — 38,573 above its historical mean. Crude Oil WTI remained relatively neutral at 141,343 contracts (28th percentile), suggesting divergent positioning strategies within the energy complex.
Top Weekly Changes
Treasury markets dominated absolute position changes, though the data showed substantial recent volatility. The 10-Year Treasury net position reached -877,853 contracts (25th percentile), reflecting a decrease of 199,990 contracts versus the 4-week average and 345,625 contracts below the 13-week baseline. The 5-Year Treasury showed even larger absolute positioning at -2,157,242 contracts (39th percentile), down 911,563 contracts from the 4-week mean.
Among non-Treasury markets, the 30-Year bond stood out with a positive 6,425 net position (91st percentile) — up 61,775 contracts versus the 4-week average and 43,021 above the 13-week mean. This divergence from intermediate-duration Treasuries suggests specific curve positioning strategies among large speculators.
The 2-Year Treasury reached -1,234,408 contracts (44th percentile), down 236,758 from the 4-week baseline. While these Treasury changes represent large absolute contract movements, their percentile rankings in the 25th-44th range indicate they remain within typical historical ranges despite recent volatility.
Category Breakdown
FX (9 markets): Three markets at 99th percentile (Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro FX), while British Pound languished at the 7th percentile with -42,404 contracts (60,350 below its mean). Japanese Yen showed neutral positioning at 12,955 contracts (45th percentile). Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real both reached the 67th percentile with net long positions of 84,122 and 34,662 respectively. Swiss Franc and New Zealand Dollar remained in net short territory at the 21st and 30th percentiles.
Metals (4 markets): Copper provided the bright spot at 59,331 contracts (90th percentile, Z-score: 1.43), sitting 26,714 contracts above its historical average. Gold (2nd percentile) and Silver (4th percentile) showed coordinated weakness. Platinum remained neutral-bearish at 12,347 contracts (21st percentile).
Energy (5 markets): Natural Gas (1st percentile) and Gasoline RBOB (95th percentile) anchored opposite extremes. Crude Oil WTI, Heating Oil, and Ethanol clustered in the 28th-73rd percentile range, suggesting no strong directional conviction in the broader energy complex.
Grains (12 markets): Soybeans reached the 93rd percentile at 191,791 contracts — 209,365 above the 105-week mean (Z-score: 1.88). Soybean Oil (73rd percentile) and Soybean Meal (71st percentile) showed related strength. Sugar #11 (1st percentile), Coffee C (1st percentile), and Cocoa (2nd percentile) dominated the weak end. Wheat HRW stood at the 82nd percentile, while Corn, Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, and Live Cattle clustered near neutral (53rd-62nd percentiles).
Index (5 markets): S&P 500 reached the 13th percentile at -173,234 contracts, sitting 92,526 contracts below its mean (Z-score: -1.17). VIX showed the 22nd percentile at -71,817 contracts. Dow Jones also remained in net short territory at -1,535 (23rd percentile). Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 hovered near neutral at the 61st and 65th percentiles respectively.
Bonds (4 markets): The 30-Year Treasury (91st percentile) diverged sharply from the 10-Year (25th), 5-Year (39th), and 2-Year (44th), creating a curve positioning pattern with net longs concentrated at the long end.
Crypto (2 markets): Bitcoin reached the 99th percentile at 1,638 contracts (Z-score: 2.16), while Micro Ethereum sat at the 20th percentile with -3,922 contracts.
Historical Context
The 105-week dataset provides robust context for current extremes. Z-scores exceeding ±2.0 occurred in seven markets this week — Australian Dollar (2.41), Canadian Dollar (2.58), Bitcoin (2.16), Coffee C (-2.36), Natural Gas (-2.29), Sugar #11 (-2.46), and Cocoa (-2.44). These readings indicate positioning more than two standard deviations from historical means, occurring roughly 5% of the time in normal distributions.
We observe that coordinated FX extremes of this magnitude have appeared only a handful of times in the 105-week window. The last comparable instance occurred during Q2 2025, when similar currencies reached extreme net long positioning ahead of a subsequent consolidation period. The current configuration shows even higher Z-scores, suggesting positioning may be reaching stretched levels relative to recent history.
Treasury positioning showed volatility but remained within one standard deviation of historical norms across most maturities. The 10-Year Treasury's -877,853 contract position sits 345,625 contracts below the 13-week average, but its 25th percentile ranking indicates this level has been reached or exceeded 75% of the time over the past two years.
Precious metals positioning at the 2nd and 4th percentiles for Gold and Silver respectively represents among the lowest net long exposure in the full dataset. Only one or two weeks showed lower readings over the past 105 weeks, suggesting speculative interest has reached multi-year lows.
📍 Key Questions for Next Week
Can FX positioning extend further, or do 99th percentile readings represent exhaustion levels? With Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Euro FX simultaneously at statistical extremes, we'll monitor whether large speculators continue adding to these positions or begin scaling back.
Will precious metals positioning stabilize near current lows, or does the 2nd-4th percentile range attract fresh net long interest? Historical patterns suggest extremes often precede mean reversion, though timing remains uncertain.
Does the divergence between 30-Year Treasury (91st percentile) and intermediate-duration notes (25th-44th percentiles) persist? This curve positioning may reflect specific yield curve views or hedging strategies worth tracking in coming weeks.
Can soft commodities exit their extreme net short territory? Sugar, Coffee, and Cocoa all sit at or near the 1st-2nd percentiles — a configuration we've observed only rarely. Whether these positions unwind or persist will provide insight into speculative conviction.
Educational Notes
The Commitment of Traders (COT) report tracks futures market positioning across commercial hedgers, large speculators (non-commercial traders), and small traders. This analysis focuses on non-commercial traders — typically hedge funds, asset managers, and other large speculative entities whose positioning can provide insight into market sentiment.
Percentile rankings show where current positioning sits relative to the past 105 weeks. A 99th percentile reading means the current net position is higher than 99% of all weekly readings in that period, while a 1st percentile indicates it's lower than 99% of observations. These extremes often (though not always) precede mean reversion, as positioning becomes statistically crowded.
Z-scores measure how many standard deviations current positioning sits from the historical mean. Readings beyond ±2.0 indicate unusual positioning that occurs roughly 5% of the time in normal distributions. However, markets can remain at extremes longer than statistical models suggest, and extreme positioning does not guarantee directional price movements.
COT data reflects positions as of Tuesday's close, released Friday afternoon. The data provides sentiment context but does not account for price levels, fundamental factors, or non-futures exposure (such as spot markets or options). Extreme positioning may reflect hedging activity, carry trades, or other strategies unrelated to directional views.

COT Report Explained: Why Most Traders Read It Wrong
FF Research Team | Feb 08, 2026 | 14 min read
The CFTC publishes three different Commitment of Traders reports. Most traders only use the Legacy report — and that is a mistake. Learn which report to use for forex, commodities, and why the distinction matters.
Every Friday afternoon, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publishes one of the most valuable datasets in financial markets: the Commitment of Traders (COT) report. It reveals how different categories of traders—from hedge funds to commercial hedgers—are positioned in futures markets. For forex and commodity traders, this is the closest thing you will get to seeing what institutional money is doing.
But here's the problem: most traders read the wrong report. The CFTC actually publishes three different COT reports, each designed for different asset classes. Using the wrong one can give you misleading data—or worse, the exact opposite signal of what's really happening.
In this guide, we'll break down exactly what the COT report is, explain the critical differences between the three CFTC reports, and show you which one to use depending on whether you trade currencies or commodities.
What Is the Commitment of Traders (COT) Report?
The COT report is a weekly publication by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a federal agency that regulates futures and options markets. It aggregates the positions of all large traders who are required to report their holdings to the CFTC.
In practical terms, the report tells you: how many contracts are hedge funds holding long or short in EUR futures? Are commodity producers increasing their hedges in gold? Is speculative money flowing into or out of crude oil?
Key Facts
1 Released: Every Friday at 3:30 PM ET (data as of Tuesday)
2 Source: Direct from CFTC.gov
3 Coverage: All major futures contracts traded on U.S. exchanges
4 Purpose: Market transparency — see where institutional money is positioned
The Three CFTC Reports (This Is Where Most Traders Go Wrong)
When traders say "the COT report," they usually mean the Legacy report—the oldest and most commonly referenced version. But the CFTC actually publishes three distinct reports, each breaking down market participants differently:
Report Categories Best For Legacy COT Commercial vs. Non-Commercial vs. Non-Reportable General overview (but oversimplified) Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) Dealer, Asset Manager, Leveraged Money, Other Forex & Financial Futures Disaggregated Producer/Merchant, Swap Dealer, Managed Money, Other Commodities
Let's look at why each report exists—and why using the Legacy report for everything is a mistake.
1. The Legacy COT Report (The "Simple" Version)
This is the original COT report and what most retail traders reference when they search for "COT data." It divides market participants into just two meaningful buckets:
1 Commercials — entities that use futures to hedge their core business risk
2 Non-Commercials (Large Speculators) — typically hedge funds and managed money
3 Non-Reportable — small traders below the reporting threshold
The Problem With Legacy
The Legacy report was designed decades ago, before the modern financial system existed. It lumps swap dealers into the "Commercial" category alongside genuine hedgers (like an airline hedging jet fuel). This creates a distorted picture: a bank's derivatives desk running speculative positions gets classified as a "hedger." For modern markets, the categories are too blunt to be useful.
2. Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) — The Right Choice for Forex
The TFF report was introduced specifically because financial futures (currencies, interest rates, equity indices) needed a more nuanced breakdown than the Legacy report could provide. It separates traders into four categories:
1 Dealer/Intermediary — sell-side banks and dealers. They facilitate client trades and typically take the other side of speculative flows.
2 Asset Manager/Institutional — pension funds, insurance companies, endowments. Large, slow-moving money with a long-term horizon.
3 Leveraged Funds — hedge funds, CTAs, and proprietary trading firms. These are the speculators you want to track.
4 Other Reportable — everyone else above the reporting threshold that doesn't fit the above.
Why "Leveraged Money" Is the Key Metric for Forex
Leveraged Funds represent hedge fund positioning — the most active, directional money in currency markets. When hedge funds are aggressively long EUR, that tells you something meaningful about institutional sentiment. The Legacy "Non-Commercial" category mixes these funds with asset managers, diluting the signal. The TFF report gives you a pure read.
This is why serious forex analysis uses the TFF report, not Legacy. Major currencies covered include EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, and the DXY (Dollar Index).
3. The Disaggregated Report — The Right Choice for Commodities
For physical commodity futures—gold, silver, crude oil, copper, platinum—the Disaggregated report provides the clearest picture. It breaks traders into:
1 Producer/Merchant/Processor/User — entities that produce or consume the physical commodity. A gold miner hedging future production, or an airline hedging jet fuel costs.
2 Swap Dealers — banks and dealers facilitating swaps. In the Legacy report, these get lumped with producers—creating a misleading "Commercial" number.
3 Managed Money — hedge funds, CTAs, and commodity pool operators. The speculative capital you want to track.
4 Other Reportable — other large traders.
Why "Managed Money" Is the Key Metric for Commodities
Managed Money in the Disaggregated report is the commodity equivalent of Leveraged Funds in TFF. These are the systematic and discretionary hedge fund managers whose positioning is most predictive of short- to medium-term price movements. When Managed Money is at record-long gold positions, the trade is getting crowded — and vice versa.
Side-by-Side: Legacy vs. The Right Report
To make the distinction crystal clear, let's look at how the same market data appears in the Legacy report vs. the more specialized reports:
Legacy Report (Gold)
Commercials: −180,000 contracts
But wait — this includes swap dealers who may be running speculative positions, not genuine hedgers. The "commercial" number is inflated and misleading.
Disaggregated Report (Gold)
Producers: −120,000
Swap Dealers: −60,000
Managed Money: +145,000
Now you can see the true picture: producers are hedging, swap dealers have their own book, and hedge funds are aggressively long.
The same issue applies to forex. The Legacy "Non-Commercial" category for EUR futures mixes hedge fund positions with pension fund rebalancing. The TFF report separates them clearly, so you know whether the positioning is speculative (momentum-driven, likely to reverse) or structural (long-term allocation, unlikely to reverse quickly).
How to Actually Read COT Data
Now that you know which report to use, here are the key metrics to track:
1. Net Positioning
The most basic metric: Long contracts minus Short contracts. If hedge funds are net long 85,000 EUR contracts, they are betting on Euro strength. Net short means they are betting on Euro weakness.
2. Weekly Changes
More important than the absolute number is the change. If hedge funds were net long 85,000 last week and now they are net long 72,000, that's a significant reduction — they are unwinding longs. This can be a leading indicator of a trend change.
3. Extreme Positioning (Z-Scores & Percentiles)
Raw contract numbers are hard to interpret in isolation. Is 85,000 contracts a lot? That depends on historical context. That's why professionals use statistical measures:
1 Z-Score — measures how many standard deviations the current positioning is from the historical mean. A z-score above +2 or below −2 signals extreme positioning.
2 Percentile — shows where current positioning ranks relative to the past 1-3 years. Above the 90th percentile or below the 10th percentile often precedes reversals.
The "Overcrowded Trade" Signal
When hedge fund positioning hits an extreme—say, net long GBP at the 95th percentile—there is simply no marginal buyer left. The risk of a liquidation-driven reversal increases sharply. This is one of the most powerful contrarian signals available to retail traders. For more on how to trade these setups, read our guide on Using CoT Data to Spot Reversals.
4. The "FLIP" — Net Position Reversal
One of the most significant events in COT analysis is a "flip" — when hedge funds go from net long to net short (or vice versa). This signals a genuine change in institutional conviction, not just trimming. A flip in Leveraged Money positioning on EUR futures, for example, often coincides with multi-week trend changes.
Summary: Which Report for Which Market?
Market Report to Use Key Category What It Tells You Forex (EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.) Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) Leveraged Money Hedge fund directional bets on currencies Commodities (Gold, Oil, etc.) Disaggregated Managed Money Hedge fund/CTA positioning in physical commodities Any market (general overview) Legacy COT Non-Commercial Aggregated — less precise, often misleading
How Forex Fundamentals Uses COT Data
At Forex Fundamentals, we don't use the Legacy COT report. We pull data directly from the CFTC and use the correct report for each asset class:
1 For currencies (EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, DXY) — we use the Traders in Financial Futures report, tracking Leveraged Money positioning
2 For commodities (Gold, Silver, Copper, Oil, Platinum, Palladium) — we use the Disaggregated report, tracking Managed Money positioning
On top of the raw positioning data, our platform automatically calculates:
1 Z-Scores — statistical extremes relative to historical data
2 Percentile rankings — where current positioning sits in the 1-year and 3-year distribution
3 FLIP detection — instant alerts when hedge funds reverse their net position
4 Weekly change tracking — see how positioning is shifting in real-time
This is all updated automatically every Friday when the CFTC publishes new data, and presented in a visual, easy-to-read format — no spreadsheets required.
Common Mistakes When Using COT Data
Mistake 1: Using Only the Legacy Report
As we've covered, the Legacy report's "Commercial" and "Non-Commercial" categories are outdated. Swap dealers get classified as commercials, inflating the hedger category. For any serious analysis, use TFF (forex) or Disaggregated (commodities).
Mistake 2: Trading COT Data as a Standalone Signal
COT data is a confirmation tool, not an entry signal by itself. Extreme positioning tells you a trend may be exhausted, but it doesn't tell you when the reversal will happen. Always combine COT analysis with your fundamental bias and technical timing.
Mistake 3: Ignoring the "Lag"
COT data is reported as of Tuesday but released on Friday — a 3-day lag. In a fast-moving market, the positioning picture could have already changed by the time you see it. This is why COT is best used for medium-term (swing and position trading) analysis rather than day trading.
The Bottom Line
The COT report is one of the most powerful publicly available datasets for understanding what "smart money" is doing. But to use it correctly, you need to understand that not all COT reports are created equal:
1 The Legacy report is widely referenced but fundamentally flawed for modern markets
2 The TFF report gives you a clean read on hedge fund forex positioning via Leveraged Money
3 The Disaggregated report gives you a clean read on hedge fund commodity positioning via Managed Money
By using the right report for the right market—and combining it with robust fundamental analysis and technical execution—you can gain an institutional edge that most retail traders don't even know exists.

COT Report Schedule & Release Times: When Does the CFTC Publish?
Feb 13, 2026
COT Basics
COT Report Schedule & Release Times: When Does the CFTC Publish?
The Commitment of Traders (COT) report is published weekly by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The schedule is consistent and predictable — once you understand how it works, you'll know exactly when to check for new data.
The Basic Schedule
Publication day: Every Friday Publication time: 3:30 PM Eastern Time (ET) Official source:CFTC Market Reports
The CFTC publishes the report on Friday afternoon, without exception, unless a federal holiday falls on a Friday (more on that below).
The Tuesday–Friday Gap: What It Means
This is the part that confuses most newcomers.
The data in each Friday report reflects positions as of the preceding Tuesday's close of business. So when you read a COT report published on a Friday, you're looking at a snapshot that is already three days old.
Example:
1 Report published: Friday, 14 February 2026 at 3:30 PM ET
2 Data reflects: Tuesday, 11 February 2026 (close of business)
3 Data age when published: 3 days
For our dashboard and weekly analysis, we label each report by its Tuesday data date, not the Friday publication date. This is the standard convention used by most professional data providers.
What "Close of Business Tuesday" Actually Means
The CFTC collects open interest data from exchanges and large clearing members at the end of trading on Tuesday. This includes:
1 All reportable long and short positions held by commercial and non-commercial traders
2 Open interest figures for each futures contract
3 Positions in both the futures and options markets (depending on report type)
The CFTC then has Wednesday and Thursday to compile, verify, and format the data before releasing it Friday afternoon.
Holiday Schedule Adjustments
When a U.S. federal holiday falls on a Monday or a Friday, the schedule shifts.
If Monday is a holiday:The data collection moves from Tuesday to Wednesday. The report is still published on Friday, but the data date is Wednesday rather than Tuesday.
If Friday is a holiday:The report is published on the following Thursday instead.
The CFTC maintains an annual schedule of adjusted release dates on their website. Major holidays to watch: Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January), Presidents' Day (February), Memorial Day (May), Independence Day (July), Labor Day (September), Thanksgiving (November), Christmas (December).
How to Find the Data Date on Each Report
Every COT report file is labelled with its data date (the Tuesday), not the publication date. On the CFTC website, the filename format is:
fut_disagg_txtonly_YYYY_MM_DD.zip
Where YYYY_MM_DD refers to the Tuesday data date.
When we process CFTC data for this dashboard, we use this date as the report identifier. In the weekly blog analysis, dates in the post title and frontmatter always refer to the Tuesday data date.
Report Types and Their Schedules
The CFTC publishes several versions of the COT report simultaneously on Friday. All share the same schedule.
Report Type Coverage Format Legacy Futures-only or Futures+Options combined Most widely used; longest history Disaggregated Breaks "Commercials" into Producer/Merchant/Processor/Swap Dealers More detail; shorter history Traders in Financial Instruments (TFF) Financial futures only Relevant for FX, bonds, stock indices Supplemental Combined futures+options for selected agricultural markets Narrow focus
This site uses the Legacy Futures-Only report. It provides the longest continuous history and covers the broadest set of markets.
Publication History: How Far Back Does the Data Go?
The Legacy COT report has been published in its current form since 1986. The CFTC also maintains historical files going back to 1983 for some markets.
For our analysis, we maintain a rolling 104-week (2-year) historical window. This is sufficient to calculate meaningful percentile rankings and Z-scores without the distortions that can occur when comparing current positioning to very distant historical periods (market structure changes significantly over a decade).
Data Delay Considerations
Three days is a meaningful lag in fast-moving markets.
During periods of sharp price moves — a central bank surprise, a geopolitical event, a major data release — the Tuesday positioning snapshot may already be outdated by the time it's published Friday. Traders who moved positions on Wednesday or Thursday won't appear in the data until the following week's report.
This is a known limitation of COT data, not a flaw specific to any particular provider. It's worth keeping in mind when interpreting extreme position readings during volatile periods.
For a full discussion of what COT data can and cannot tell you, see our Methodology page.

The COT report is a positioning indicator — it measures what large futures market participants are actually doing with their money. Other sentiment tools measure different things: stated opinions, options hedging behaviour, or survey responses.
Understanding the difference matters. Each tool has a specific strength and a specific blind spot.
The Four Main Sentiment Tools
COT Report
What it measures: Actual futures positions held by large institutional participants, sorted by trader type (commercial, non-commercial).
Strengths:
1 Reflects real money, not stated opinions
2 Covers a broad range of futures markets (FX, commodities, equity indices, bonds)
3 Long historical record — usable data going back 30+ years for major markets
4 Consistent methodology across markets
Weaknesses:
1 3-day publication lag — not useful for short-term decisions
2 Legacy format lumps different speculator types together
3 No information on why positions were taken or where entry levels are
Best for: Medium-term context on crowding and potential exhaustion in futures markets.
AAII Investor Sentiment Survey
The American Association of Individual Investors publishes a weekly survey asking members whether they are bullish, bearish, or neutral on equities over the next 6 months.
What it measures: Stated opinion of retail investors — not actual positions.
Strengths:
1 35+ years of history
2 Widely used as a contrarian indicator for US equities
3 Simple and transparent methodology
Weaknesses:
1 Covers US equities only — no commodity, FX, or bond coverage
2 Measures intention, not execution. Respondents may say "bearish" while remaining fully invested
3 Small survey sample size relative to total market participation
Best for: Gauging retail equity sentiment as a contrarian backdrop. Most useful at extreme readings (above 60% bulls or above 50% bears).
Put/Call Ratio
The put/call ratio measures the volume of put options traded relative to call options on a given exchange or index.
What it measures: Hedging and speculative demand in the options market — a real-money indicator.
Strengths:
1 Real-time and exchange-derived — no publication lag
2 Reflects actual market activity, not surveys
3 Useful across equity indices, individual stocks, and some ETFs
Weaknesses:
1 Dominated by institutional hedging, which distorts the retail sentiment reading
2 Limited relevance outside equity markets — poor coverage of commodities and FX
3 Requires normalisation to be useful (a ratio that looks "extreme" today may be normal in a high-volatility regime)
Best for: Short-term equity hedging demand. Works well alongside VIX and price action for near-term timing.
Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey
Published monthly, this survey polls global institutional fund managers on their asset allocation, risk appetite, and macro views.
What it measures: Stated positioning and views of large institutional asset managers — not retail.
Strengths:
1 High-quality institutional respondents managing large pools of capital
2 Covers global asset allocation across equities, bonds, commodities, cash, and regions
3 Tracks relative overweight/underweight positioning — useful for identifying crowded consensus views
Weaknesses:
1 Monthly frequency — significantly lower resolution than weekly COT data
2 Shorter history than COT
3 Stated allocation may differ from actual portfolio execution
Best for: Identifying consensus macro positioning and potential contrarian opportunities at the multi-asset level.
VIX and Implied Volatility
The VIX measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility in the S&P 500, derived from options prices.
What it measures: Expected price movement — not directional positioning. A high VIX means the market expects large moves in either direction, not necessarily a decline.
VIX is often misused as a sentiment indicator. It measures uncertainty and fear, but a low VIX does not mean the market is positioned bullishly — it means it expects calm conditions.
Best for: Volatility regime context. Useful alongside positioning data, not as a substitute for it.
How to Use These Together
No single indicator captures the full picture. A practical approach for equity markets:
1 COT data for equity index futures positioning context
2 AAII survey for retail sentiment backdrop
3 Put/call ratio for near-term hedging demand
4 Fund manager survey for institutional consensus
When multiple indicators point in the same direction simultaneously, the signal is more meaningful. Divergence between indicators often signals a transition period.
For commodity and FX markets, the COT report is typically the most useful single tool available — survey data has poor coverage, and options markets are less liquid.

Commercial vs Non-Commercial Traders: What's the Difference?
Feb 17, 2026
COT Fundamentals
The COT report divides futures market participants into three reporting categories. Each group trades for different reasons. That difference in motivation is what makes the data useful.
This post explains who each group is, why they trade, and what their positioning tells you.
The Three Groups at a Glance
The CFTC requires large futures traders to report their positions weekly. These positions are then sorted into three categories:
1 Commercials — hedgers with a business reason to hold the underlying commodity or instrument
2 Non-Commercials — large speculators trading purely for profit
3 Non-Reportable — everyone below the reporting threshold (mostly small retail traders)
The first two groups are where the analytical value sits. Non-reportable positions are generally treated as noise.
Commercials: Hedgers
Commercials are businesses that use futures to manage risk, not to speculate.
A wheat farmer shorts wheat futures to lock in a sale price before harvest. A gold mining company hedges future production. An airline buys crude oil futures to cap fuel costs. These are commercial participants — they hold the underlying asset or need it as an input.
Key characteristics:
1 They are classified as commercial because they demonstrate a hedging purpose to the CFTC
2 Their positions are often large and move slowly
3 They frequently hold positions that are "wrong" from a short-term price perspective — and that is by design
What their positioning signals:
Commercials are often used as a contrarian indicator. When they are heavily short (i.e. heavily hedging), it usually means they expect prices to stay elevated or are locking in currently high prices. Extreme commercial short positioning in a commodity often coincides with historically high price levels.
The logic is: if a producer is aggressively locking in forward prices, they probably think current prices are attractive. That is bearish for speculative buyers.
Non-Commercials: Large Speculators
Non-commercials are funds and managed money accounts with no hedging purpose. They trade to profit from price moves.
This group includes hedge funds, commodity trading advisors (CTAs), and other large managed accounts. They take directional bets and tend to follow trends.
Key characteristics:
1 Their positions reflect market sentiment and trend conviction
2 They often hold large concentrated positions in one direction
3 They are momentum-driven — they buy rising markets and sell falling ones
What their positioning signals:
Non-commercial positioning is the most widely followed component in COT analysis. Extreme net long or short readings are used as potential exhaustion signals.
When speculative longs are at a 5-year high, it means most of the buyers who want to own the position already own it. New buyers become scarce. The market becomes vulnerable to reversal.
This is not a precise timing tool — the signal can persist for weeks before resolving. But it identifies when a market is stretched.
Why They Move in Opposite Directions
Commercials and non-commercials frequently take opposite sides of the same trade.
When a speculator (non-commercial) goes long crude oil, someone on the other side is short. Often, that counterparty is a commercial hedger — an oil producer locking in a forward sale.
This creates a structural pattern: as speculative longs increase, commercial shorts tend to increase too. The two groups are counterbalanced by the mechanics of futures markets.
This is why COT analysis often focuses on the spread between commercial and non-commercial positioning, not just one group in isolation.
Non-Reportable: Small Traders
The non-reportable category consists of traders whose positions fall below the CFTC's reporting threshold. It is a residual — calculated by subtracting reported positions from total open interest.
This group is mostly retail traders and small funds. Their aggregate positioning rarely provides a useful signal. Some analysts treat extreme small-trader sentiment as a contra-indicator, similar to retail sentiment surveys, but the evidence is weak and inconsistent.
For practical COT analysis, focus on commercials and non-commercials.
Which Group to Watch
There is no universal answer — it depends on what you are trying to measure.
If you want to... Watch... Identify potential trend exhaustion Non-commercial extremes Gauge producer conviction about prices Commercial hedging levels Measure overall speculative sentiment Non-commercial net position Spot divergences between groups Both simultaneously
The dashboard at cotdashboard.com tracks non-commercial positioning as the primary signal, with percentile ranks calculated over a 104-week rolling window. This lets you compare current speculative positioning to its own history — not just in absolute contract terms.
What These Categories Don't Tell You
The classification is imperfect. A large fund that also has a hedging operation can be classified as commercial. Some commodity index funds are classified as non-commercial despite being passive, not directional.
The CFTC introduced the Disaggregated COT report in 2009, which splits non-commercials into managed money, swap dealers, and other reportables. That report gives more granularity but covers fewer markets.
For most major futures markets — crude oil, gold, S&P 500, euro, Treasury bonds — the legacy COT categories remain the most widely used and most liquid dataset for positioning analysis.

Do Extreme COT Positions Predict Reversals?
Feb 17, 2026
COT Analysis
The short answer: sometimes, and not reliably on their own.
Extreme COT positioning is a useful context indicator — it tells you when a market is stretched. It does not tell you when a reversal will happen, or whether it will happen at all before the position unwinds gradually.
Here is what the data shows and where the logic breaks down.
What "Extreme" Means in COT Terms
A position becomes extreme when speculative net longs (or shorts) reach an unusually high percentile rank relative to historical readings.
On the cotdashboard.com platform, extremes are defined as:
1 95th–100th percentile — historically extreme net long positioning
2 0th–5th percentile — historically extreme net short positioning
These thresholds are calculated using a 104-week (two-year) rolling window. A market at the 97th percentile means speculative positioning is more net long than in 97% of the weeks over the past two years.
The intuition behind using extremes as a reversal signal is straightforward: if nearly everyone who wants to be long already is, the pool of new buyers shrinks. Without fresh buyers, prices struggle to move higher.
The Hit Rate Question
The honest answer to "do extremes predict reversals?" depends heavily on:
1 How you define reversal — a 3% move, a 10% move, a full trend change?
2 Over what timeframe — 4 weeks, 13 weeks, 6 months?
3 How extreme is extreme — top 10%, top 5%, top 2%?
The general pattern from historical analysis:
1 At shorter timeframes (4 weeks), extreme readings perform barely better than chance
2 At medium timeframes (13 weeks), there is a modest edge at the most extreme thresholds
3 The 26-week window shows the strongest results, but with significant variance across markets
This means COT extremes are better thought of as a medium-term context signal rather than a timing tool.
Why the Logic Holds — And Where It Breaks Down
Why it holds:
Futures positioning is a finite resource. Positioning cannot grow indefinitely. A market where 97% of historical weeks showed fewer speculative longs is, by definition, near a ceiling of speculative demand.
When sentiment reverses — due to macro data, a price shock, or simply time — the unwind of crowded positions amplifies the move. Funds that are long all exit at once, creating acceleration on the downside.
Where it breaks down:
Crowded trades can stay crowded for a long time. A market at the 95th percentile can reach the 99th percentile. It can stay above the 90th percentile for 20 weeks before unwinding.
COT data also has a structural lag: the data reflects positions as of Tuesday, published Friday. By the time the report is public, the market has already moved three days. In fast-moving markets, this lag reduces the signal's practical value.
Additionally, the signal completely ignores why positions are extreme. A speculative net long at the 97th percentile in crude oil during a geopolitical supply shock is a very different situation from the same reading in a calm trending market. COT data gives you no information about the fundamental driver.
What Happens After an Extreme Reading
In markets where the signal has historically worked, the typical sequence looks like this:
1 Speculative positioning reaches extreme (95th+ percentile)
2 Price continues rising for a period — sometimes weeks — as momentum holds
3 Positioning begins to unwind gradually or abruptly
4 Price reversal follows, often with a lag of several weeks
The key observation: the signal tends to precede the price peak, not coincide with it. Calling the exact top is not possible using COT data alone.
What Makes the Signal More Reliable
Several conditions improve the usefulness of extreme COT readings:
Confirmation from price action. If positioning is at a 95th percentile extreme but price is also hitting multi-year highs and showing momentum exhaustion signals, the setup is stronger than positioning alone.
Divergence. When price makes a new high but positioning does not confirm (i.e. speculative longs are declining while price rises), that divergence is a more specific warning than extreme positioning alone.
Cross-market context. An extreme in crude oil positioning carries more weight if energy equities, refinery margins, and dollar positioning are also at inflection points.
Duration of the extreme. A position that has been at the 95th+ percentile for 8 consecutive weeks carries more exhaustion risk than one that just crossed the threshold.
What the Signal Should Not Be Used For
Entry timing. "COT is extreme, therefore sell now" is not a valid use of the data. The signal has no short-term precision.
Standalone trade signals. COT data works best as one input among several. Using it alone has poor risk-adjusted results in most systematic backtests.
Low-liquidity or thinly traded markets. In markets with low open interest or irregular reporting, the percentile ranks are less stable and the signal is noisier.
Practical Application
The most common professional use of COT extremes is as a filter, not a trigger.
A fund might decide: "We will only take new long positions in this market if speculative positioning is below the 60th percentile." This does not generate trade signals — it removes trades that would be working against a crowded positioning setup.
Similarly, an extreme reading can be used to tighten risk management on an existing long position. Not as a reason to exit immediately, but as a reason to move stops closer and reduce position size.
Summary
Question Answer Do extremes predict reversals? Sometimes — at medium timeframes and high thresholds Is it a precise timing tool? No — lag can be weeks to months What improves the signal? Divergence, price confirmation, duration Can it be used standalone? Not reliably Where is it most useful? As a filter or risk management input
The cotdashboard.com percentile rankings give you a consistent way to identify extreme readings across multiple markets simultaneously. That is the primary value — not generating signals, but flagging which markets are in stretched territory so you can apply additional analysis there.

FAQ: COT Data for Beginners
Feb 17, 2026
COT Fundamentals
This page answers the questions that come up most often from traders new to the COT report. No jargon, no filler — just direct answers.
Is the COT report free to access?
Yes. The CFTC publishes all COT data at cftc.gov at no cost. It is available in CSV and legacy text formats, updated every Friday at 3:30 PM Eastern Time.
The raw data files are functional but not user-friendly — they contain hundreds of markets in a flat text format. Most traders use a third-party tool or dashboard (like cotdashboard.com) that processes and visualises the data.
How often is the COT report published?
Weekly. The CFTC records positions as of Tuesday each week and publishes the report the following Friday at 3:30 PM ET.
This creates a 3-day lag between data collection and public release. By the time you see the report, it is already three trading days old. In fast-moving markets, positions can change significantly in that window.
What does "net long" mean?
Net long = total long contracts minus total short contracts.
If a trader group holds 80,000 long contracts and 30,000 short contracts, their net position is +50,000 — they are net long by 50,000 contracts.
A positive net position means the group is betting on higher prices overall. A negative net position (net short) means they are positioned for lower prices.
What does "net short" mean?
The opposite of net long. If a group holds more short contracts than long contracts, their net position is negative — they are net short.
For commercial hedgers (producers, processors), being net short is normal and does not necessarily signal a bearish view. A grain farmer selling futures to lock in prices will be net short regardless of where they think prices are going. For non-commercial speculators, net short does reflect a directional bearish view.
What is a percentile rank in COT data?
A percentile rank shows where the current positioning reading sits relative to its own history.
If the current net long position is at the 90th percentile, it means it is higher than in 90% of historical weeks in the comparison window. The cotdashboard.com platform uses a 104-week (2-year) rolling window.
Percentile ranks solve a real problem: raw contract numbers are not comparable across markets or across time. A net long position of 100,000 contracts means very different things in crude oil versus wheat. Percentile ranks normalise this, making cross-market comparisons valid.
What are the extreme zones?
The cotdashboard.com dashboard uses five zones:
Zone Percentile range Interpretation Extreme Net Long 95–100th Historically very high speculative longs Above Average 75–95th Elevated but not extreme Mid-Range 25–75th No unusual signal Below Average 5–25th Reduced speculative exposure Extreme Net Short 0–5th Historically very low (or net short)
Readings in the extreme zones (top or bottom 5%) are where COT analysis generates the most discussion. See What Are Percentile Rankings in COT Data? for a full explanation.
Can I use COT data to time trades?
Not precisely. This is one of the most important things to understand before using the report.
Extreme COT readings flag when speculative positioning is historically stretched. They do not predict when — or even whether — a reversal will happen. A market at the 97th percentile can reach the 99th. It can stay above the 95th for 20 consecutive weeks.
COT data works best as a filter and context tool. It tells you when a market is crowded, which should affect how you size and manage positions — not necessarily whether to enter or exit immediately.
What is the difference between Legacy and Disaggregated COT?
The Legacy COT is the original format. It divides participants into three groups: Commercials, Non-Commercials, and Non-Reportable.
The Disaggregated COT was introduced in 2009. It splits non-commercials into four sub-groups: Producers/Merchants, Swap Dealers, Managed Money, and Other Reportables. This gives a clearer picture of who is doing what, but covers fewer markets and has a shorter history.
For most COT analysis, including the cotdashboard.com dashboard, the legacy format is used — it has broader coverage and a longer historical record.
Which markets does COT data cover?
The legacy COT report covers most major US futures markets, including:
1 Equity indices: S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones, Russell 2000
2 FX: EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD, MXN, BRL
3 Energy: Crude oil (WTI and Brent), natural gas, heating oil, RBOB gasoline
4 Metals: Gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium
5 Agricultural: Corn, wheat, soybeans, soy oil, soy meal, cotton, sugar, coffee, cocoa
6 Bonds: 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year US Treasuries
Not every futures contract is reported. Smaller or less liquid contracts may be excluded or bundled.
What is open interest?
Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not yet been settled or closed.
It is different from trading volume. Volume counts how many contracts were traded in a session. Open interest counts how many are still open — held overnight.
Rising open interest alongside rising prices generally suggests new money is entering the trend — a healthy sign for trend continuation. Falling open interest alongside rising prices suggests short covering rather than new buying — a weaker signal.
COT data is published as a proportion of total open interest, which helps contextualise position sizes across markets.
Where should I start?
If you are new to COT data, the recommended reading order is:
1 What Is the COT Report? — the foundation
2 How to Read COT Data — practical walkthrough
3 What Are Percentile Rankings in COT Data? — understanding the signal
4 Commercial vs Non-Commercial Traders — understanding who is who
5 COT Data Limitations — what the data cannot tell you
Once those are clear, the market-specific guides (energy, metals, FX, etc.) give context for individual markets.

Glossary of COT & Futures Terms: Plain-English Definitions
Feb 14, 2026
COT Basics
Glossary of COT & Futures Terms
A reference glossary for terms used in COT report analysis. Definitions are written for clarity, not exhaustiveness. Where relevant, notes explain how each term applies specifically to our analysis.
C
CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)The U.S. federal agency that regulates commodity futures and options markets. The CFTC publishes the Commitment of Traders report weekly. Website: cftc.gov
COT Report (Commitment of Traders Report)A weekly report published by the CFTC showing how different categories of market participants are positioned in futures markets. Published every Friday at 3:30 PM ET, reflecting data from the preceding Tuesday. The most widely used version for macro analysis is the Legacy Futures-Only report.
Commercial Traders (Hedgers)Entities that use futures to hedge a business exposure. A wheat farmer selling futures to lock in a price, an airline buying crude oil futures to hedge jet fuel costs, a bank using currency futures to manage foreign exchange risk — all are commercial traders. They are required to demonstrate that their futures positions relate to underlying business activity.
In COT data, commercials often hold the opposite position to large speculators. When speculators are heavily net long, commercials are typically net short, and vice versa. This is a structural feature, not a signal in itself.
Contrarian IndicatorA way of interpreting COT data where extreme speculator positioning is read as a potential signal for a price reversal. The reasoning: if nearly everyone who can go long already has, there are fewer remaining buyers to push prices higher. This is a common use of COT data in trading analysis, though it is not a reliable timing tool on its own.
D
Dealer / IntermediariesA trader category in the Disaggregated COT report. Refers to financial intermediaries such as swap dealers and large banks. Not used in the Legacy report format.
Disaggregated COT ReportA newer version of the COT report that breaks down the "Commercial" category into sub-groups: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User, Swap Dealers, Managed Money, and Other Reportables. Provides more granularity than the Legacy report but has a shorter historical record. We use the Legacy format on this site.
F
Futures ContractA standardised agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Futures are traded on exchanges (e.g., CME, CBOT, ICE). COT data covers futures (and optionally options) positions.
H
HedgerSee: Commercial Traders.
L
Large SpeculatorsSee: Non-Commercial Traders.
Legacy COT ReportThe original, longest-running version of the COT report. Divides traders into three categories: Commercial, Non-Commercial, and Non-Reportable. The Legacy format has continuous data going back to the 1980s for most markets. This is the format used by this site.
Long PositionA futures position that profits if the price of the underlying asset rises. A trader holding 1,000 long gold futures contracts expects gold prices to increase.
Long-Short RatioThe ratio of long contracts to short contracts for a given trader category. Not used in our analysis directly — we focus on net positions.
M
Managed MoneyA trader category in the Disaggregated COT report. Refers primarily to hedge funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). Broadly equivalent to the "Non-Commercial" category in the Legacy report, though the classification is slightly different.
Market SentimentA general term for the overall positioning or directional bias of market participants. COT data is one tool used to assess market sentiment. Other sentiment tools include options skew, surveys, and volatility measures.
N
Net LongWhen a trader category holds more long contracts than short contracts. Example: a non-commercial net long position of +150,000 means the group holds 150,000 more long contracts than short contracts. A positive net position.
Net PositionLong contracts minus short contracts for a given trader category. The primary metric used in our analysis.
1 Positive net position = net long
2 Negative net position = net short
3 Zero = balanced (long contracts equal short contracts)
Net ShortWhen a trader category holds more short contracts than long contracts. Expressed as a negative number. Example: -80,000 means 80,000 more short contracts than long contracts.
Non-Commercial Traders (Large Speculators)Traders who do not have a commercial hedging reason for their futures positions — they trade futures to make a profit. In practice, this category is dominated by hedge funds, commodity trading advisors (CTAs), and large asset managers. This is the primary category analysed on this site.
Non-commercial positioning is reported as separate long, short, and spreading figures. Net position is calculated as: long minus short (excluding spreading).
Non-Reportable Positions (Small Traders)The residual category in the Legacy COT report — traders whose positions are below the CFTC's mandatory reporting thresholds. Typically small retail traders. Non-reportable positions are calculated as: total open interest minus reportable positions. We note this category but do not centre analysis on it.
O
Open InterestThe total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled or closed. Each open contract represents one buyer and one seller. Open interest is a measure of market activity and liquidity. Rising open interest during a price move suggests new money entering the market; falling open interest suggests positions being closed.
On our dashboard, the "Index" column shows open interest for each market.
P
Percentile RankA measure of where the current net position falls relative to historical observations. If gold's non-commercial net long position is at the 95th percentile, it means the current reading is higher than 95% of all weekly observations in the historical window.
On this site, percentiles are calculated empirically over a rolling 104-week (2-year) window. A 99th-percentile reading means the position is near the top of the two-year range; a 1st-percentile reading means near the bottom.
Percentile extremes (above 95th or below 5th) are highlighted in our weekly analysis as noteworthy, not as trade signals.
R
Reportable PositionsPositions above the CFTC's minimum reporting thresholds. Traders holding above these levels must report their positions to the CFTC. Thresholds vary by market. The sum of commercial and non-commercial reportable positions, plus non-reportable, equals total open interest.
S
Short PositionA futures position that profits if the price of the underlying asset falls. A trader holding 500 short crude oil contracts expects oil prices to decrease.
SpreadingHolding simultaneous long and short positions in different contract months of the same futures market (calendar spread) or in related but different markets. Spreading positions are reported separately in the COT report and are excluded when calculating net long/short figures.
Swap DealerA trader category in the Disaggregated COT report. Typically large financial institutions that deal in over-the-counter swaps and use futures to hedge those exposures. Not a category in the Legacy report format.
T
TFF Report (Traders in Financial Instruments)A COT report variant focused exclusively on financial futures: interest rates, currencies, stock indices, and certain other instruments. Breaks down traders into Dealer/Intermediary, Asset Manager/Institutional, Leveraged Funds, and Other Reportables. More relevant for FX and bond analysis than the Legacy report.
Total Open InterestThe sum of all outstanding futures contracts in a given market. Equals the sum of reportable commercial positions, reportable non-commercial positions, and non-reportable positions (for both long and short sides, divided by two, since each contract has one buyer and one seller).
Z
Z-ScoreA statistical measure of how far the current value is from the historical mean, expressed in standard deviations.
Formula: (Current Value − Historical Mean) / Standard Deviation
Interpretation:
1 Z-score of 0: At the historical mean
2 Z-score of +1.0: One standard deviation above mean (roughly 84th percentile in a normal distribution)
3 Z-score of +2.0: Two standard deviations above mean (roughly 97th percentile) — statistically unusual
4 Z-score of −2.0: Two standard deviations below mean — statistically unusual in the other direction
We calculate Z-scores over a 104-week rolling window. A Z-score above ±2.0 is flagged as a statistically notable positioning extreme.
Z-scores and percentile ranks are complementary. Percentile rank shows where the current reading sits in the empirical distribution; Z-score shows how many standard deviations from the mean it sits, assuming a roughly normal distribution.

History of the CFTC and COT Report
Feb 17, 2026
COT Fundamentals
The Commitment of Traders report is one of the longest-running public datasets in financial markets. The CFTC has been publishing some form of trader positioning data since 1962. Understanding where it came from clarifies what it was designed to do — and what it was not.
The Origins: Grain Market Oversight
The regulatory roots of the COT report go back to the early 20th century, when grain markets were a focal point of US economic policy.
The Grain Futures Trading Act of 1922 was the first significant federal law governing futures markets. It required large grain traders to report their positions to regulators. The stated purpose was to detect and deter market manipulation — not to provide a public sentiment indicator.
The Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 expanded this framework to cover additional commodities and introduced restrictions on certain speculative activities. Position reporting continued under these rules, though the data was primarily used internally by regulators.
The CFTC Is Established: 1974
The modern era of futures regulation began with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, which created the CFTC as an independent federal agency.
Before 1974, futures oversight was split between the Department of Agriculture (for agricultural commodities) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (for financial instruments). The creation of the CFTC consolidated oversight under one agency and extended it to cover the growing number of financial futures products.
The CFTC formally took over COT reporting from its predecessor agencies and continued the practice of publishing aggregated trader position data.
COT Goes Weekly: 1992
The frequency and format of COT reports changed significantly over the decades.
Early reports were published monthly, then bi-weekly. In 1992, the CFTC shifted to weekly publication — positions as of Tuesday, published the following Friday. This 3-day lag has remained the standard ever since.
The weekly cadence made the data substantially more useful to analysts tracking how positioning was changing in response to market events. A monthly snapshot captures almost nothing about intra-month shifts in sentiment.
The Legacy COT Format
The "legacy" COT report — still published today — divides market participants into three categories:
1 Commercials — entities with a demonstrated hedging purpose
2 Non-Commercials — large speculators with no hedging purpose
3 Non-Reportable — everyone below the reporting threshold
This format remained largely unchanged from the 1960s through the 2000s. It works well for identifying broad speculative sentiment but has a structural problem: it lumps very different types of non-commercial participants together.
A passive commodity index fund that simply buys and rolls futures is classified identically to an active macro hedge fund taking a strong directional view. Their implications for market sentiment are very different.
The Disaggregated Report: 2009
In 2009, the CFTC introduced the Disaggregated COT report to address this limitation.
The new format split the old non-commercial category into four groups:
1 Producer/Merchant/Processor/User — physical market participants (equivalent to commercials)
2 Swap Dealers — financial intermediaries, often running commodity index exposure
3 Managed Money — hedge funds and CTAs with active directional strategies
4 Other Reportables — large traders that don't fit the other categories
This separation allowed analysts to distinguish between passive index-driven flows (swap dealers) and active speculative positioning (managed money) — a distinction invisible in the legacy report.
The disaggregated format covers physical commodity and selected financial futures markets. It does not cover all markets in the legacy report, and its history only extends back to 2006.
Which Format Is Used Most
For most practical COT analysis, the legacy report remains the standard.
Reasons include:
1 Longer historical record (usable data back to the early 1990s for most markets)
2 Broader market coverage, including FX, equity indices, and Treasuries
3 Simpler structure — easier to compare percentile ranks across markets consistently
The disaggregated report is more useful when you specifically want to separate managed money from passive index flows — relevant in agricultural and energy commodities where commodity index exposure is large.
The cotdashboard.com platform uses the legacy COT format with a 104-week rolling percentile window. This gives consistent, comparable readings across all markets in the dataset.
CFTC Data Today
The CFTC now publishes COT data every Friday at 3:30 PM Eastern Time, covering positions as of the previous Tuesday. The data is freely available at cftc.gov in CSV and legacy text formats.
The agency also publishes:
1 Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) — similar to the disaggregated report but focused on financial futures
2 Cotton On-Call — specific to cotton markets
3 Index Investment Data — tracks commodity index fund exposure quarterly
For the vast majority of COT analysis, the standard Legacy or Disaggregated weekly reports are what analysts use.

They do not treat it as predictive. The COT report describes where positioning is now, not where price will go. Funds that treat extremes as precise predictions of reversal quickly learn the lesson that crowded trades can get more crowded.
The Percentile Rank Approach
The most consistent institutional use of COT data centres on percentile ranks rather than raw contract numbers.
Raw positions are not comparable across markets or across time. A net long position of 200,000 contracts in crude oil carries completely different implications from 200,000 contracts in wheat. Absolute numbers are almost meaningless without context.
Percentile ranks normalise this. A 90th percentile reading in any market means the same thing: positioning is more extreme than in 90% of historical periods. This makes cross-market comparisons valid and consistent.
The cotdashboard.com platform uses a 104-week (2-year) rolling percentile window. This captures recent positioning cycles while excluding very old data that may no longer reflect current market structure.

How to Read COT Data: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Commitment of Traders Report

How to Read COT Data: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Commitment of Traders Report
The raw CFTC Commitment of Traders report is a spreadsheet with dozens of columns and hundreds of rows. It is not designed for readability.
This guide explains how to extract the useful information, what the numbers mean, and how to put them in context. If you are new to the report itself, start with What Is the COT Report? first.

11 Tools and Downloads
12 Quick Reference Table
Step 1: Find the Net Position
The single most important number in any COT report line is the net position of non-commercial traders (large speculators).
The calculation:
Net Position = Long Contracts − Short Contracts
If hedge funds hold 250,000 long contracts and 180,000 short contracts in gold, the net position is +70,000. They are "net long 70,000 contracts."
What it tells you: the directional lean of speculative money. Positive means speculators expect prices to rise. Negative means they expect prices to fall.
On our dashboard, this is the "Speculators" column. Green means net long. Red means net short.
Step 2: Check the Weekly Change
A static net position number is less useful than knowing which direction it is moving.
The CFTC provides weekly change data for each trader category. If gold net longs went from +70,000 last week to +85,000 this week, speculators added 15,000 contracts of net long exposure.
What to watch for:
1 Large weekly changes relative to the market's normal range. A 5,000-contract move in natural gas is routine. A 50,000-contract move is not.
2 Direction of change vs. price direction. If crude oil prices fell this week but speculators added longs, that is a divergence worth noting.
3 Consecutive weeks in the same direction. Three or more weeks of steady long-building (or short-building) suggests a developing trend in positioning, not just noise.
On our dashboard, the "CHG" column shows the weekly change. Green for increases, red for decreases.
Step 3: Look at Both Sides — Commercials vs Speculators
Commercials (hedgers) and non-commercials (speculators) usually take opposite sides of the market. This is structural — commercials are hedging the risk that speculators are taking on.
The typical dynamic:
When speculators are heavily net long, commercials are heavily net short. Speculators are betting prices will rise. Commercials are locking in current prices to protect their business.
When this relationship breaks down, pay attention. If both groups are moving in the same direction, something unusual is happening. It could indicate a fundamental shift in supply/demand dynamics, or one group unwinding hedges.
Common analytical framework:
1 Commercials net short + Speculators net long = normal positioning. Speculators are driving the bullish side.
2 Commercials moving toward neutral while speculators are at extremes = the "smart money" may be stepping aside.
3 Both groups reducing positions simultaneously = falling open interest, which often precedes consolidation.
Step 4: Check Open Interest
Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts in a market. It shows how much capital is committed.
Three patterns to know:
Rising price + rising open interest = new money entering in the direction of the trend. The move has conviction.
Rising price + falling open interest = short covering. Prices are rising because shorts are exiting, not because new buyers are entering. The rally may be less durable.
Extreme net positioning + high open interest = a crowded trade. Many participants are on the same side. This creates conditions for a sharp reversal if the trade starts to unwind.
On our dashboard, open interest is shown in the "Index" column.
Step 5: Put It in Historical Context
A net long position of 70,000 contracts in gold means nothing in isolation. Is that high? Low? Average?
This is where percentile rankings matter.
If the current net long is at the 95th percentile of the past 2 years, positioning is more extreme than 95% of the prior 104 weekly readings. That is a crowded trade.
If it is at the 30th percentile, it is unremarkable.
How percentiles work on our site:
We rank the current net position against every weekly reading in our COT report historical data. A 99th percentile reading means the position is near its highest. A 1st percentile reading means it is near its lowest.
Percentiles above 90 or below 10 are flagged as "near extremes" in our weekly COT report analysis. These are the data points worth the most attention.
Z-scores add another layer. A Z-score tells you how many standard deviations the current position is from the historical average. A Z-score of +2.0 means the position is two standard deviations above the mean — statistically unusual. Below −2.0 is equally unusual on the short side.
Full calculation details are on our methodology page.
Step 6: Compare Across Markets
Reading one market in isolation misses the broader picture. Some of the most useful COT analysis comes from comparing positioning across related markets.
Examples:
Treasury complex. If 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasuries all show extreme net short positioning, that is a broad institutional bet on higher interest rates. If only the long end is short while the short end is neutral, speculators are betting on a steeper yield curve.
Currency markets. When speculators are net long USD against most major currencies simultaneously, that is a consensus dollar-bullish trade. Mixed positioning — long vs. EUR but short vs. JPY — gives a more nuanced picture.
Energy sector. Crude, natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline often move together, but not always. Divergences can reflect seasonal factors, supply disruptions, or refining margin trades.
Metals. Gold and silver usually move directionally together, but the magnitude often differs. Silver positioning tends to be more volatile and more speculative.
The dashboard filter buttons let you isolate one sector at a time.
A Practical Example: Reading Gold
The raw numbers:
Group Long Short Net Non-Commercial 285,000 40,000 +245,000 Commercial 120,000 350,000 -230,000 Open Interest — — 520,000
What you extract:
1 Speculators are heavily net long (+245,000). They expect gold prices to rise.
2 Commercials are heavily net short (-230,000). They are hedging — miners locking in prices, banks offsetting swap exposure.
3 The two sides roughly offset, which is normal.
Now add context:
1 This week's net long is +245,000. Last week it was +230,000. Speculators added 15,000 net longs.
2 The 2-year percentile for this net long is 97th. Near the most bullish speculative positioning in 2 years.
3 The Z-score is +2.1. More than 2 standard deviations above the mean.
4 Open interest rose by 12,000 contracts. New money entered the market.
The interpretation:
Speculative positioning in gold is at a 2-year extreme and still building. This does not mean gold will reverse. It means the long trade is crowded, and any catalyst — unexpected dollar strength, a shift in rate expectations — could trigger rapid unwinding.
That is not a trade signal. It is context that makes every other piece of gold analysis more informed.
What COT Data Cannot Tell You
Timing. Extreme positioning can persist for weeks or months. A 99th percentile reading does not mean a reversal is imminent. It means the trade is crowded. Those are different statements.
Causation. The COT report shows correlation at best. Speculators piling into longs reflects that they already expect prices to rise. By the time the data is published, the positions are 3 days old.
Intraday or short-term moves. The data is weekly. It tells you nothing about what happened on Wednesday afternoon.
Options positioning. The standard COT report covers futures only. Options positioning is not included in the Legacy format.
Why positions were taken. A net short in Treasuries could be a directional bet on higher rates, a hedge against a bond portfolio, or a relative value trade. The report does not distinguish intent.
Does Extreme COT Positioning Predict Reversals?
The honest answer: sometimes, but not reliably enough to use as a standalone indicator.
Academic research and backtesting show that extreme speculative positioning has some predictive value for subsequent returns — particularly at the tails (above 90th or below 10th percentile). But the effect is probabilistic, not deterministic.
What extreme positioning does reliably is identify asymmetry. When everyone is long, the upside is limited (who is left to buy?) and the downside is amplified (a lot of positions to unwind). The reverse holds for extreme shorts.
This is why COT data functions as a contrarian indicator in many analytical frameworks — not as a standalone system, but as a filter that adjusts risk assessment. It is context, not signal.
COT Report Release Schedule
The CFTC publishes the Commitment of Traders report on a fixed weekly schedule.
1 Data snapshot: Every Tuesday at market close
2 Publication date: Every Friday at 3:30 PM Eastern
3 Lag: 3 calendar days between snapshot and publication
4 Holiday schedule: If Monday is a U.S. federal holiday, publication is sometimes delayed to the following Monday
5 Official source:CFTC.gov
We publish our weekly COT report analysis every Friday after the 3:30 PM release. The latest breakdown is always at /blog.
Tools for Reading COT Data
Raw CFTC data. The CFTC publishes reports in text and Excel format on their website. Functional but not user-friendly for quick analysis.
Our dashboard. We parse the raw CFTC data weekly and display it with category filters, weekly changes, and open interest. Available at /dashboard.
Weekly analysis. Every Friday we publish a quantitative COT report breakdown with percentile rankings and Z-scores across all 41 markets. Available at /blog.

Summary
Reading COT data comes down to a repeatable six-step process:
1 Check the net position — which way are speculators leaning?
2 Check the weekly change — is that lean increasing or decreasing?
3 Compare commercials vs speculators — is the normal dynamic intact?
4 Check open interest — is money flowing in or out?
5 Add historical context — percentiles and Z-scores show if positioning is extreme
6 Compare across markets — sector-level patterns often matter more than individual markets
None of these steps produce a trade signal. All of them produce better-informed analysis.

How to Read the COT Report — I Built a Live Excel Dashboard Pulling 11 Years of CFTC Data

How to Read the COT Report — I Built a Live Excel Dashboard Pulling 11 Years of CFTC Data
And why the last 20% nearly broke me
The CFTC publishes Commitment of Traders data every Friday. It's free, it's public, and it covers 41 markets across FX, metals, energy, indices, bonds, and crypto.
Most traders either ignore it or look it up manually once in a while on a third-party site.
I wanted something different: a single COT report chart that auto-refreshes every week, shows me net positioning for every market at a glance, calculates a 52-week percentile index, and flags extreme positioning automatically — without me touching it.
Here's exactly how I built it, and where it gets genuinely complicated.
What the COT Report Is — and Why Traders Use It
Before getting into the build, it's worth understanding what CFTC COT data actually measures and how to read a COT report in practice.
The Commitment of Traders report breaks market participants into three groups:
Non-Commercials (large speculators — hedge funds, managed money). These are the trend followers. They tend to pile in late and get caught at extremes.
Commercials (hedgers — producers, exporters, corporates). These are the people who actually need the underlying asset. Airlines hedge jet fuel. Farmers hedge corn. They tend to be on the right side of the market over time.
Non-Reportables (small speculators). Less useful for analysis.
The most common use of COT report analysis is watching when Non-Commercial positioning reaches a historical extreme — because crowded trades tend to reverse. If every speculator is net long AUD and the COT Index hits 100, there are no more buyers left. That's the setup.
This isn't a crystal ball. Understanding how to use the COT report means treating it as a sentiment indicator, best used alongside price action, not instead of it.
What the Finished Dashboard Looks Like
The finished COT report chart: Australian Dollar full history, 52-week rolling COT Index, and extreme alert flags for both speculators and commercials.
The file has two main sections:
Left panel — Speculators (Non-Commercial): Long contracts, Short contracts, % Long, % Short, Net Position, Week-on-Week Change, COT Index (52-week percentile), and an Extreme Alert flag.
Right panel — Commercials: Same columns. The Commercial COT Index often runs inverse to the Speculator index, which serves as a useful confirmation.
A dropdown at the top lets you select any of the 41 markets. The entire commitment of traders chart updates in one click — no manual data entry, no copy-pasting from the CFTC website.
Max, Min, Average, and Latest rows at the top give you immediate context. Green means extreme long territory. Red means extreme short. The cells are conditionally formatted based on the actual 52-week range, not arbitrary thresholds.
The Architecture: Three Layers
Layer 1 — The CFTC API (The Easy Part)
The CFTC exposes a public Socrata API at:
https://publicreporting.cftc.gov/resource/6dca-aqww.json
You can query it directly from Power Query with a Web connector. The basic call to get a specific market's CFTC COT data looks like:
https://publicreporting.cftc.gov/resource/6dca-aqww.json ?cftc_contract_market_code=232741 &$limit=5000 &$order=report_date_as_yyyy_mm_dd DESC
Each market has a unique CFTC contract code. Australian Dollar is 232741 . Euro FX is 099741 . Getting all 41 codes right — and verifying they map to the correct market — took longer than expected. Some codes have a + suffix. Some markets share similar names. The debug step here is non-trivial.
Layer 2 — Power Query Transformations (Where It Gets Messy)
Once the raw JSON lands in Power Query, you need to:
1 Parse the nested JSON structure
2 Cast columns to correct data types (dates as dates, positions as integers)
3 Filter to only the columns you need (there are 170+ columns in the raw feed)
4 Handle nulls — early CFTC COT historical data records have missing fields that will break calculations if not accounted for
5 Deduplicate (the API occasionally returns duplicate rows for the same report date)
6 Sort descending by date so your most recent 52 rows are always rows 1–52
The column names in the raw API are not intuitive. Non-commercial long positions are noncomm_positions_long_all . Commercial short positions are comm_positions_short_all . You'll be mapping these to readable names across 41 queries.
To avoid 41 separate connections, I structured it as one parameterised query that accepts a market code and returns a clean table. A second query passes in the selected market code from the dropdown cell. This keeps the workbook from becoming a maintenance nightmare.
Layer 3 — The COT Index Formula (The Interesting Part)
The COT Index is how you read COT report positioning in historical context. It's a percentile rank of the current Net Position against the prior 52 weeks:
COT Index = (Current Net − 52W Min) / (52W Max − 52W Min) × 100
1 0 = current net position is at its 52-week low
2 100 = current net position is at its 52-week high
3 Above 90 triggers an EXTREME LONG alert
4 Below 10 triggers an EXTREME SHORT alert
In Excel, calculating this across a rolling 52-week window — dynamically, as new data comes in each week — requires either a helper column approach or an array formula. I used a dynamic array formula referencing the Power Query output table, which means it recalculates automatically on refresh.
The edge case that catches people: the first year of data has fewer than 52 weeks available. You need a formula that gracefully handles a shorter window without returning errors. Getting that conditional logic right across 41 markets, with named ranges that update dynamically, is where most of the build time went.
COT Report Trading Strategy — How to Actually Use the Data
Knowing how to read the COT report is one thing. Knowing when the signal matters is another. A few principles worth understanding:
Extremes are more meaningful than direction alone. A COT Index of 85 doesn't tell you much. A COT Index of 98 — sustained for three consecutive weeks — starts to mean something. The further from the mean, the fewer times in recent history the market has been this crowded.
COT report forex analysis tends to be cleaner than commodities. FX majors (EUR/USD, AUD/USD, GBP/USD) have large, liquid speculative positioning with well-documented historical cycles. Commodity markets like natural gas or cocoa can sit at extremes for months during supply shocks.
Commercial and Speculator divergence is the core signal. When Commercials are at an extreme net long and Speculators are at an extreme net short in the same market, that's the alignment traders watch for. The dashboard flags this as a FLIP indicator.
COT data lags. The weekly COT report covers positioning as of Tuesday close, published Friday. By the time you're reading it, the market has moved three more days. It's a positioning map, not a real-time ticker.
The Refresh Process
When the CFTC publishes Friday's report (usually by 3:30 PM EST), you open the file and hit Data → Refresh All. Power Query fires 41 API calls, pulls the latest weekly COT report data, and the entire dashboard updates in about 90 seconds.
No CSV downloads. No copy-pasting. No manual formula updates.
That's the part that took the most engineering to get right — and what makes this different from every static COT spreadsheet I've seen sold online.
What I Didn't Cover Here
A complete COT report explained in full would need to walk through:
1 Setting up the parameterised Power Query in detail
2 The full market code reference table for all 41 instruments
3 Handling the API's rate limiting and occasional downtime
4 The conditional formatting rules and how they're tied to the dynamic ranges
5 Debugging when a market code returns empty data (it happens)
6 The FLIP indicator logic (when both Commercials and Speculators move in the same direction — a rarer but significant signal)
7 Per-market nuances: how to read a gold COT report differs slightly from how to read a COT report for natural gas or EUR/USD, because their speculator bases behave differently
That's realistically 15–20 hours of building and debugging for someone starting from scratch, assuming you're comfortable with Power Query. If you're newer to it, add another 10 hours.
If You Want the Finished File
I've already put those hours in.
The completed file covers all 41 markets, auto-refreshes from the CFTC API, and includes the COT Index, Extreme Alerts, and the FLIP indicator — ready to use from day one.

Introduction to Fundamental Analysis in Forex
FF Research Team | Jan 26, 2026 | 10 min read
What is fundamental analysis in forex? Learn the 6 key economic factors that move currency prices and how to apply them in your trading.
What is Fundamental Analysis in Forex?
Fundamental analysis in forex is a method of evaluating currencies by examining the economic, political, and social factors that influence their value. Unlike technical analysis which studies price charts and patterns, fundamental analysis answers the question: why is a currency strong or weak?
The core principle is simple: currencies reflect the health of their underlying economy. A growing economy with rising interest rates attracts foreign investment, which increases demand for that currency. Fundamental analysis helps traders identify which currencies are likely to strengthen or weaken over time based on economic data.
Fundamental vs Technical Analysis
Fundamental TechnicalWhy price movesWhere price might go Economic data & news Charts & patterns Sets direction Improves timing
Most successful traders combine both: fundamentals to determine which direction to trade, technicals to find optimal entry and exit points.
Key Factors That Move Currencies
1. Interest Rates (Most Important)
Higher interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns → more demand for the currency → stronger currency. This principle is the foundation of the carry trade strategy.
What to Watch
Central bank rate decisions, forward guidance, and how inflation compares to the bank's target. Learn more about how the Fed communicates in our Dot Plot guide.
2. GDP Growth
Strong economic output signals a healthy economy, increasing demand for its currency. When comparing currency pairs, look at the relative growth rates between countries.
3. Employment Data
A key indicator of economic health. The US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report is widely regarded as the most market-moving monthly release, often causing significant volatility in USD pairs.
4. Inflation
The relationship between inflation and currency strength depends on how central banks respond:
1 High inflation → central bank may raise rates to cool the economy → currency strengthens
2 Low inflation → central bank may cut rates to stimulate growth → currency weakens
Note: Markets react to expectations. If a rate hike is already "priced in," the actual announcement may have little effect.
5. Trade Balance
1 Trade surplus (exports > imports) → foreign demand for the currency increases → stronger currency
2 Trade deficit (imports > exports) → more currency flows out → weaker currency
6. Political & Geopolitical Factors
Elections, policy changes, geopolitical tensions, and unexpected events can cause sudden volatility. Stability tends to support a currency; uncertainty weakens it.
The Challenge for Retail Traders
Proper fundamental analysis requires tracking:
1 Economic calendars across 8+ countries
2 Central bank statements and speeches
3 Dozens of monthly indicators
4 Breaking news and shifting sentiment
5 Institutional positioning via CoT reports
This is time-consuming. Institutional traders have dedicated research teams. Most retail traders don't have 2-3 hours daily to stay on top of everything.
A Practical Solution: Forex Fundamentals Platform
Instead of spending hours on manual tracking, Forex Fundamentals automates the heavy lifting and presents everything in a clear, actionable format.
Currency Bias Scores
We aggregate economic data, central bank policy, and market conditions into a single fundamental score per currency. At a glance, you can see which currencies are fundamentally strong, neutral, or weak:
Currency bias scores based on real-time economic data and central bank policy analysis
With this view, you can quickly identify which currencies are fundamentally strong or weak — pairing strength against weakness for data-driven trade ideas.
Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
Fundamentals tell you what should happen. Sentiment tells you when the market is ready to move. Our platform monitors news flow, central bank communications, and market commentary to give you a real-time sentiment reading for each currency. When sentiment aligns with fundamentals, you have a high-conviction setup.
Economic Calendar with Context
Most economic calendars just list events. Ours shows you why each release matters and how it fits into the bigger picture. Before NFP, you'll know what the market expects, what would be a surprise, and how it could shift USD bias.
The Bottom Line
Our platform calculates currency scores automatically, tracks sentiment in real-time, and alerts you when fundamentals shift — so you can focus on trading, not research.
How to Apply Fundamental Analysis
1 Build your bias per currency — Analyze each currency individually. Is USD bullish or bearish based on current fundamentals? What about EUR? Our platform gives you a fundamental score for each major currency, so you can quickly identify strength and weakness.
2 Watch market sentiment — Fundamentals set the direction, but sentiment drives short-term moves. Track how the market is interpreting news and data releases. Our real-time sentiment indicators show you what traders are thinking right now.
3 Look for trends in the data — One data point rarely changes the bigger picture. Is inflation trending higher over multiple months? Is employment consistently strong? Trends in economic data confirm or challenge your bias.
4 Stay systematic — Don't react to every headline. Focus on high-impact events relevant to your pairs, and let a structured dashboard filter the noise for you.
Put these concepts into practice.

Mastering Fundamental Analysis Forex: Where to Begin
FF Research Team | Feb 06, 2026 | 12 min read
Learn the essentials of fundamental analysis forex, including macroeconomic factors, news events, and how institutions forecast currency trends.
If you have ever watched a perfectly good technical setup fail instantly because of a sudden price spike, you have experienced the power of fundamentals. Many retail traders spend years mastering chart patterns, only to find themselves blindsided by market movements they didn't see coming.
The reality of the foreign exchange market is that while technical analysis tells you when to enter a trade, it is fundamental analysis that tells you why the market is moving—and more importantly, where it is going next.
Understanding forex fundamentals is not just about trading the news; it is about analyzing the underlying health of an economy to predict the future demand for its currency. This approach, often called global macro analysis, is the lens through which professional hedge funds and banks view the market.
Global macro analysis: the institutional approach to forex trading
The Core Concepts of Global Macro Analysis
At its heart, macroeconomics in forex is the study of supply and demand on a global scale. Just as a stock trader analyzes a company's balance sheet to determine if a stock is cheap or expensive, a forex trader analyzes a country's economic conditions to determine the value of its currency.
1. Analyzing Economic Conditions
A currency is essentially a proxy for the country's economy. When a country's economy is growing, its currency tends to strengthen. This happens because a strong economy leads to higher interest rates, which attract foreign investors seeking a better return on their capital.
To understand these conditions, traders must monitor data points like GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment figures. These metrics act as the fuel for currency trends. If the data is strong, the central bank is likely to raise rates, boosting the currency. If the data is weak, the central bank may cut rates, weakening the currency.
2. Finding Intrinsic Value
One of the most powerful concepts in fundamental trading is intrinsic value. This is the calculated "true" value of a currency based on economic data and purchasing power, as opposed to its current market price.
Markets are not always efficient. Fear, greed, and speculation can push a currency's price far away from its intrinsic value. A fundamental trader looks for these discrepancies. If your analysis shows that the Euro is undervalued relative to the US Dollar based on economic performance, you have a high-probability bias to go long, regardless of what the short-term noise on the chart says.
3. Key Fundamental Factors
While there are hundreds of economic indicators, successful global macro analysis boils down to three primary fundamental factors:
1 Central Bank Policy: This is the number one driver of currency trends. Interest rates dictate the flow of money around the world.
2 Geopolitics & Stability: Capital seeks safety. Political instability scares away investors, weakening the currency.
3 Trade Flows: Countries with a trade surplus (exporting more than they import) naturally see higher demand for their currency.
The Market Movers: What to Watch
Not all currencies and news events are created equal. To effectively apply fundamental analysis, you need to focus on the assets and events that matter most.
Why Focus on Major Pairs?
Fundamental analysis is most effective when applied to major pairs such as the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD.
These pairs possess the deepest liquidity and are heavily traded by large institutions. Because of this massive volume, they tend to respect macroeconomic data more reliably than exotic pairs, which can be easily manipulated by low volume or erratic speculation. When the US economy shows strength, the USD/JPY pair reacts logically; an obscure exotic pair might not.
News Analysis vs. Noise
A common trap for beginners is trying to trade every single news release. Effective news analysis requires filtering out the noise and focusing on high-impact events.
Key Event: Non-Farm Payrolls
The undisputed king of market-moving events is the Non-Farm Payroll report (NFP) released by the United States. This report measures the number of jobs added to the US economy (excluding farm workers) and serves as a key gauge of economic health. A strong NFP number often leads to a rally in the US Dollar, while a weak number can cause a sell-off. Understanding how to interpret the NFP is a prerequisite for understanding forex volatility.
Institutional Level Analysis
Retail traders often wonder how the "smart money"—the big banks and hedge funds—approach the market. They do not rely on simple trend lines; they use data-driven models and deep research.
Quantitative Tests and Models
Institutions use sophisticated quantitative tests and econometric models to measure currency strength. These models input vast amounts of data—interest rate differentials, inflation expectations, and growth forecasts—to output a probability of a currency's direction.
For the average trader, building these models from scratch is incredibly complex. However, access to this data is becoming easier. Platforms like Forex Fundamentals are designed to bridge this gap, providing a clear fundamental outlook by running these econometric models in the background and presenting the data in a single, user-friendly interface.
Leveraging Financial Institutions Forecasts
You don't have to do all the heavy lifting yourself. Major banks like Goldman Sachs, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank publish financial institutions forecasts. These reports detail their outlook on currency pairs for the coming months or years.
The challenge has always been aggregating these scattered reports. This is where a centralized tool becomes essential. By using a service that consolidates reports from all major news sources and banks, you can quickly see the consensus of the "smart money." Instead of hunting for PDFs, you get a unified fundamental outlook that helps you trade with institutional confidence.
From Theory to Action: Building Your System
Knowledge without execution is useless. To profit from fundamentals, you must organize this information into a structured approach.
Developing a Fundamental Trading Strategy
A solid fundamental trading strategy combines macro analysis with technical execution. A simple framework looks like this:
1 Analyze the Macro Bias: Use your econometric data to determine if the economy is improving or deteriorating. (Determine Direction: Long or Short).
2 Check the Sentiment: Are the aggregated financial institutions forecasts aligning with your view?
3 Technical Entry: Use charts to find a safe entry point in the direction of your fundamental bias.
Creating Fundamental Trading Systems
For those who prefer a more rigid approach, you can build fundamental trading systems. Unlike discretionary trading, a system follows strict rules based on data.
Example System Rule
"I will only look for buy signals on GBP/USD if UK inflation is rising, and the Bank of England has signaled a rate hike."
By codifying your fundamental analysis into rules, you remove emotion and ensure that you are always trading in line with the economic reality.
Conclusion
Technical analysis can help you time your entry, but it is fundamental analysis that gives you the conviction to hold a trade for the big moves. By understanding economic conditions, monitoring major pairs, and keeping an eye on fundamental factors, you move from gambling on price ticks to investing in economies.
Whether you build your own spreadsheets or use a platform like Forex Fundamentals to combine bank reports and econometric models for you, the key is consistency. Start by analyzing the intrinsic value of one currency pair this week—that is the first step toward trading like a professional.
Put these concepts into practice.

Seasonal Patterns in Futures Positioning
Feb 17, 2026
COT Analysis
Some futures markets show positioning tendencies that repeat on an annual cycle. These patterns are driven by predictable seasonal factors: planting and harvest schedules, energy demand cycles, fiscal year-end flows, and recurring macro events.
Seasonal patterns in COT data are tendencies, not rules. A supply shock, monetary policy shift, or geopolitical event can override any seasonal pattern at any time.
Why Seasonal Patterns Exist
Several structural forces create recurring positioning cycles:
Physical supply and demand cycles. Agricultural markets are directly tied to crop calendars. Energy markets follow predictable demand patterns (summer driving, winter heating). These physical cycles drive hedging activity from commercial participants, which in turn affects the overall positioning picture.
Speculative anticipation. Speculative traders often position ahead of anticipated seasonal demand changes. Crude oil longs tend to build before peak summer driving season — not during it. The positioning move anticipates the fundamental, not reacts to it.
Institutional calendar effects. Funds operate on fiscal year schedules. Position reduction near year-end (December) and rebuild in January is a recurring pattern in several markets. Quarter-end rebalancing creates similar shorter-cycle effects.
Event clustering. Federal Reserve meeting schedules, USDA crop reports, and OPEC production decisions tend to cluster at certain times of year. These events drive positioning adjustments that can look seasonal because the events themselves recur.
Agricultural Markets
Agricultural futures show the clearest seasonal positioning patterns of any asset class, driven directly by crop calendars.
Grains (corn, wheat, soybeans): Speculative positioning tends to build ahead of planting season (March–May) as traders take views on expected supply. Positioning often peaks or reverses around key USDA crop reports in May and June. A second positioning cycle occurs around harvest (September–October) as actual yields become known.
Weather uncertainty is the primary driver of positioning spikes in agricultural markets. A drought forecast in the US Midwest can compress a multi-month positioning build into days.
Soft commodities (coffee, cotton, sugar): Similar harvest-driven cycles apply, but the specific timing depends on the crop's growing region and season. Brazilian sugar and coffee harvests (March–May) drive a different seasonal pattern than US cotton harvest (October).
Energy Markets
Energy futures have two dominant seasonal drivers: summer driving demand and winter heating demand.
Crude oil: Speculative long positions often begin building in March–April in anticipation of peak summer driving season (June–August). US refineries increase crude purchases to produce summer gasoline, creating commercial demand that supports prices. Speculative longs frequently peak in May–June and then reduce into autumn.
Natural gas: The pattern runs opposite to crude. Speculative positioning builds ahead of winter heating season (October–November) and tends to unwind in spring. Summer storage injection data (April–October) also drives periodic positioning adjustments.
These patterns are well-known and frequently priced in by markets. A positioning build into summer driving season is "expected" — an unexpected disruption (refinery outage, geopolitical event) is what drives the real move.
Equity Index Futures
Equity positioning shows several calendar tendencies:
Year-end reduction: December often sees speculative positions in equity index futures decline as funds lock in returns, reduce risk, and manage year-end redemptions. This creates a structural headwind for equity futures positioning regardless of market direction.
January rebuild: Position reduction in December is frequently followed by rebuilding in January as funds re-establish directional exposure. This can exaggerate January equity market moves in either direction.
Summer seasonality: The "sell in May" pattern — reduced equity performance and positioning from May through September — has a weak but recurring statistical basis. Institutional traders are aware of it, which partly explains why it persists and partly why it periodically fails.
FX Markets
FX positioning seasonality is less pronounced than commodities but still observable:
US dollar: Dollar positioning tends to be influenced by the Federal Reserve meeting schedule. Periods with clustered Fed meetings (March, June, September, December) often see larger positioning adjustments than quieter months.
Emerging market currencies: Speculative exposure to EM currencies typically reduces into the northern hemisphere summer as liquidity falls and risk appetite decreases. This is a tendency, not a reliable rule.
Metals Markets
Gold: Speculative long positioning in gold tends to build during periods of elevated macro uncertainty, which historically cluster in Q1 (after year-end repositioning) and Q3 (pre-US election years). Physical demand from India and China around festival seasons (October–November) provides additional seasonal support.
Copper: Copper positioning follows Chinese demand cycles more than a simple calendar. The Chinese New Year (January–February) typically marks a construction slowdown that reduces copper demand, often reflected in positioning. Q2 tends to see positioning rebuild as Chinese construction activity resumes.
How to Use Seasonal Patterns with COT Data
The most defensible application of seasonal patterns is as context, not as a primary signal.
A useful question is: "Is current positioning consistent with or diverging from typical seasonal behaviour?"
If speculative crude oil longs are building in March–April (consistent with seasonal norms), that tells you relatively little — the pattern is expected. If they are declining sharply in March–April (against seasonal norms), that is worth examining further. Something is overriding the usual cycle.
Seasonal analysis works best when:
1 The current positioning is notably different from seasonal expectations
2 The divergence aligns with a fundamental change in supply, demand, or monetary conditions
3 The seasonal pattern has been consistent across multiple years, not just one or two
Limitations of Seasonal Analysis
Seasonal patterns in COT data are derived from historical averages. Individual years deviate significantly from those averages.
COVID-19 in 2020 obliterated seasonal patterns across virtually every futures market simultaneously. The 2022 energy shock from the Ukraine conflict overrode normal crude oil and natural gas seasonal cycles completely.
Seasonal patterns are also self-defeating to some degree. As more traders become aware of a seasonal tendency, they position earlier to capture it — which gradually erodes the pattern's timing and magnitude.
Use seasonal context as one factor among several, weighted less heavily than current fundamentals and price action.

The Best Forex Swing Trading Strategy: A Fundamental Approach
FF Research Team | Feb 06, 2026 | 10 min read
Discover why combining fundamental analysis with swing trading creates the highest-probability setups for capturing multi-day moves in forex.
Most retail traders believe swing trading is purely about drawing lines on a chart. They are wrong. While technical analysis helps you time your entry, it is fundamental analysis that determines the direction of the trend. For a swing trader holding positions for days or weeks, understanding the economic engines behind currency moves is not optional—it is the difference between gambling and trading.
This guide explores how to use macroeconomic data to capture high-probability "swings" and how to streamline this complex analysis using an all-in-one approach.
The Core Philosophy: Fundamentals for Direction, Technicals for Timing
The most profitable forex swing trading strategies rely on a simple formula: Fundamentals tell you WHAT to buy or sell. Technicals tell you WHEN to do it.
Over a period of minutes, price is noise. But over a period of days—the swing trader's timeframe—price always gravitates toward economic reality. Money flows to where it is treated best, which usually means countries with higher interest rates and stronger economic growth. This is the foundation of the carry trade strategy.
The "Strong vs. Weak" Strategy
To apply this practically, successful swing traders use a methodology called Strong vs. Weak Analysis. You don't just trade random pairs; you deliberately pair the strongest currency in the market against the weakest one.
The Strong Currency
Backed by a hawkish Central Bank (raising rates), rising GDP, and a strong labor market.
The Weak Currency
Burdened by a dovish Central Bank (cutting rates), recession fears, or political instability.
By pairing strength against weakness, you align your trade with the natural flow of capital in the global economy. This isn't speculation—it's following the money.
The Challenge: Information Overload
The biggest hurdle for swing traders is the sheer volume of data. Trying to manually track GDP releases from the Eurozone, inflation data from the US, and employment figures from Australia—while cross-referencing them with Central Bank speeches—can be overwhelming.
This is where many traders fail. They revert to "naked" charts because the fundamental data is too scattered across the web.
The Solution: The All-in-One Fundamental Edge
Modern swing trading isn't about opening 50 browser tabs; it's about consolidation. To trade effectively, you need a single source of truth that aggregates economic health, sentiment, and central bank policies.
This is the philosophy behind platforms like Forex Fundamentals. By centralizing the data, you can spot the "Strong vs. Weak" setups instantly without getting lost in the noise.
A Professional Swing Trading Workflow
Here is how you can use an all-in-one perspective to execute a high-probability trade:
1. The Macro Scan (The "What")
Instead of guessing, check your dashboard. Which Central Bank is the most hawkish? Which is the most dovish?
Example Setup
You see the Fed is holding rates high (USD Strong), while the BoJ is maintaining negative rates (JPY Weak). Your bias is set: Buy USD/JPY.
2. Sentiment Check (The Context)
Is the market in a "Risk-On" or "Risk-Off" mood? Using sentiment tools, you confirm that institutional money is flowing into the USD as a safe haven. This confirms your fundamental bias.
Understanding how institutional money positions itself is crucial. The Commitments of Traders (CoT) report provides valuable insight into whether a trade is becoming overcrowded—a warning sign for potential reversals.
3. The Technical Trigger (The "When")
Now—and only now—do you look at the chart. You are not looking for any trade; you are looking specifically for a Buy signal on USD/JPY.
1 Wait for a pullback to a key support level on the Daily or 4-Hour chart
2 Look for price action confirmation (a bullish candle pattern, a break of structure)
3 Enter the trade when the chart confirms your fundamental thesis
Key Insight
When your fundamental bias aligns with the technical entry, you have a high-conviction trade. You're not guessing—you're trading with the economic trend at your back.
The Power of Interest Rate Differentials
One of the most powerful concepts in swing trading is understanding how interest rate differentials drive currency flows. This is the institutional secret behind long-term trends.
When there is a significant gap between two countries' interest rates, capital naturally flows from the low-yield currency to the high-yield currency. This creates sustained trends that can last for months. For a deep dive into this concept, read our comprehensive guide on The Carry Trade: Profiting from Interest Rate Differentials.
Managing Risk Events
Swing trading exposes you to "Overnight Risk." Since you hold trades for days, your position will likely be open during high-impact news releases.
Using an integrated platform helps here, too. Instead of being blindsided by a sudden speech or data release, you can visualize upcoming "Tier 1" events directly alongside your analysis.
The Golden Rule
If the fundamental story changes (e.g., inflation suddenly drops when you were betting on it rising), close the trade. Do not hope; react to the data.
Putting It All Together
Here is a summary of the fundamental swing trading framework:
1 Identify the strongest and weakest currencies using economic data and central bank policy
2 Confirm with sentiment — ensure the market mood aligns with your thesis
3 Wait for a technical trigger in the direction of your fundamental bias
4 Manage risk events by staying aware of upcoming high-impact data releases
5 React to changing fundamentals — exit if the economic story shifts
Conclusion
Swing trading offers the perfect balance for traders seeking significant returns without the stress of day trading. However, charts alone are not enough.
By combining the precision of technical analysis with the power of fundamental data—and using the right tools to simplify that data—you align yourself with the "Smart Money." You stop fighting the market and start riding the real economic waves that drive it.

The Carry Trade: Profiting from Interest Rate Differentials
FF Research Team | Jan 20, 2026 | 8 min read
An introduction to one of the most popular institutional trading strategies in forex.
The Carry Trade is the bedrock of FX flows. In simple terms, it involves borrowing a low-interest-rate currency (like JPY or CHF) to buy a high-interest-rate currency (like USD or GBP), profiting from the differential (swap).
While retail traders focus on 15-minute charts, trillions of dollars move based on these yield differentials. Understanding "Carry" explains why a currency pair can trend upwards for months despite bad news—as long as the yield spread remains attractive, institutions will hold.
Put these concepts into practice.

The Dot Plot Explained: Reading the Fed's Mind
FF Research Team | Jan 22, 2026 | 5 min read
Why the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) moves markets more than the rate decision itself.
The Federal Reserve's "Dot Plot"—formally known as the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)—is arguably the most scrutinized chart in global finance. It's released four times a year, typically in March, June, September, and December, coinciding with FOMC meetings that include a press conference. The Dot Plot maps out where each FOMC member expects interest rates to be at the end of the current year and for the next several years.
Why it matters more than the hike
While the immediate rate decision (e.g., a 25bps hike) is often priced in by the futures market weeks in advance, the Dot Plot provides the "forward guidance" that reprices the yield curve. A "hawkish surprise" in the dots—signaling rates will stay higher for longer—can send the US Dollar soaring even if the Fed pauses rates on the day.
Key Trading Insight
Don't just look at the median dot for the current year. Pay attention to the dispersion (disagreement) among members and the long-run neutral rate (r*). An upward shift in the long-run dot is a structural bullish signal for USD.
Deciphering the Projection Materials
Beyond the dots, the SEP includes forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and PCE inflation. A common setup for a reversal trade is when the Fed projects lower growth but higher inflation (stagflationary concerns), which complicates their policy path.
Institutional traders compare these projections against market pricing (OIS swaps). If the market expects 3 cuts next year but the Fed only projects 1, that divergence creates a volatility opportunity as one side eventually capitulates.
Put these concepts into practice.

Understanding COT Data for Bond Markets
Feb 14, 2026
Market Guides
US Treasury futures are the largest financial futures market in the world by open interest and notional value. The COT report for Treasury futures offers a window into how large speculators — primarily macro hedge funds and CTA trend-followers — are positioned along the US yield curve.
This guide covers the four Treasury futures we track, explains how bond positioning differs from commodity positioning, and identifies the patterns worth understanding before reading this data.
The Four Treasury Futures We Track
All four are CBOT-listed interest rate futures. Each contract represents a different point on the US yield curve.
Symbol Market CFTC Code Contract Size Notional (approx) ZT 2-Year Treasury Note 042601 $200,000 face ~$200,000 ZF 5-Year Treasury Note 044601 $100,000 face ~$100,000 ZN 10-Year Treasury Note 043602 $100,000 face ~$100,000 ZB 30-Year Treasury Bond 020601 $100,000 face ~$100,000–$150,000
Note: Because Treasury prices change as interest rates change, the actual notional exposure per contract varies. The 30-Year bond has much higher duration (price sensitivity per basis point) than the 2-Year note. A net position of 50,000 contracts in 30Y bonds represents far more interest rate risk than 50,000 contracts of 2Y notes.
How Bond Futures Positioning Works
Bond positioning is expressed in terms of price direction, not yield direction. This requires a translation step that commodity traders sometimes miss:
1 Net Long bonds = expecting prices to rise = expecting yields to fall = rate-cut or safe-haven positioning
2 Net Short bonds = expecting prices to fall = expecting yields to rise = rate-hike or risk-on positioning
At extreme net short readings in Treasury futures, large speculators are collectively positioned for higher interest rates (lower bond prices). At extreme net long readings, they are positioned for lower rates (higher bond prices).
Left: current net positions and percentile ranks across 2Y, 5Y, 10Y, and 30Y Treasury futures. Right: the yield curve with each maturity labelled by the direction of speculative positioning — green annotations indicate net long, red indicate net short.
Reading the Yield Curve from COT Data
The four Treasury futures together provide a picture of how speculators are positioned across the entire yield curve. This creates several informative configurations:
All four net short (bear steepener/flattener views): Speculators across the entire curve are betting on higher rates. This is common in rate-hiking cycles.
Short at the long end, neutral or long at the short end (steepener): Speculators expect long-term yields to rise relative to short-term yields — a steepening of the yield curve. This often reflects expectations of stronger growth or higher inflation in the future.
Long at the short end, short at the long end (flattener): Speculators expect the short end to be supported (by central bank policy) while the long end rises. Or they expect long-term yields to rise independently. This is a yield curve flattening trade.
All four net long: Speculators across the curve expect lower rates. This is common in periods of recessionary concern, financial stress, or when the market prices aggressive rate cuts.
Duration Matters When Comparing Positions
A direct comparison of contract counts between the 2Y and 30Y futures is misleading without adjusting for duration.
The 10-Year Treasury note has roughly six times the price sensitivity per contract of the 2-Year note. The 30-Year bond has even more. This means:
1 A 100,000-contract net short in the 30Y bond represents a much larger economic position (rate-rise bet) than 100,000 contracts net short in the 2Y note.
2 When comparing positioning "extremes" across maturities, the percentile rank is a better comparative tool than the raw contract count — it normalises each market against its own history.
Our dashboard reports net contracts and percentile ranks. For a proper duration-adjusted analysis of total Treasury positioning, you would need to weight each contract by its DV01 (dollar value of a basis point), which is beyond the scope of this dataset.
What Drives Treasury Futures Positioning
Three main forces drive speculative positioning in Treasury futures:
Federal Reserve policy expectations. The most powerful driver. When markets price in rate hikes, net short positioning in Treasuries tends to build. When rate cuts are expected, net long positioning builds.
Inflation data. Surprise inflation readings cause rapid repositioning, especially in the long end of the curve (5Y, 10Y, 30Y), where inflation expectations have the largest impact on yield.
Risk-on / Risk-off sentiment. Treasuries are a safe-haven asset. During equity market stress, speculative short positioning in Treasuries can unwind quickly as traders seek lower-risk holdings — even if the macro rate outlook has not changed.
The Commercial Side in Bond Markets
In Treasury futures, commercial traders are primarily financial institutions managing interest rate exposure on their balance sheets — banks, insurance companies, pension funds. Their hedging behaviour differs from commodity commercials (who hedge physical inventory).
Treasury commercials are large, constant hedgers. Their positions reflect asset-liability management rather than directional views on rates. This makes the non-commercial (speculative) positioning relatively more informative in Treasury markets compared to some commodity markets where the commercial/non-commercial distinction is less clean.
Limitations Specific to Bond Markets
Duration mismatch makes cross-maturity comparison difficult. As covered above, comparing raw contract counts across maturities without duration adjustment is imprecise. Use percentile ranks for cross-maturity comparison.
US Treasury positioning does not represent global bond markets. COT data covers CBOT-listed US Treasury futures. The positioning does not reflect views on European, UK, or Japanese government bonds. Global rate differentials (which often drive currency positioning) are therefore only partially visible through this dataset.
Very large open interest means small percentage changes look small. The 10Y Treasury futures contract regularly has open interest exceeding 4 million contracts. A 50,000-contract shift in net positioning is roughly 1% of open interest — meaningful, but it represents a small fraction of total positioning compared to the same number in a market like Platinum.
Intraday positioning is not captured. The COT report shows Tuesday closing positions, reported Friday. Rapid intraweek repositioning around major data releases (CPI, FOMC decisions) is not visible in this weekly snapshot.

Understanding COT Data for Equity Index Markets
Feb 13, 2026
Market Guides
Equity index futures COT data shows how large speculators — primarily hedge funds and commodity trading advisors — are positioned in the major US stock index futures. This category is distinct from others in one key respect: the "commercial" hedgers here are primarily institutional investors using futures to hedge equity portfolio risk, not physical commodity producers.
This guide covers the five index futures we track and explains the dynamics that make this category behave differently from commodity or FX markets.
The Five Index Futures We Track
Symbol Market CFTC Code Contract Value (approx) Exchange ES S&P 500 13874+ $250 × index ($500K+) CME NQ Nasdaq 100 20974+ $20 × index ($400K+) CME YM Dow Jones 12460+ $5 × index ($200K+) CBOT RTY Russell 2000 239742 $50 × index ($100K+) CME VX VIX 1170E1 $1,000 × index CBOE
Contract values fluctuate with index levels, unlike commodity contracts with fixed quantities. At current market levels, a single ES (S&P 500) contract represents over $500,000 in notional exposure.
How Index Futures Positioning Works
A net long position in S&P 500 futures means speculators collectively hold more buy contracts than sell contracts — they expect the index to rise. A net short position means the reverse.
One important distinction from commodity markets: the direction of price and the direction of demand are less tightly coupled. A declining stock market can attract both short sellers (profiting from declines) and long buyers (averaging into weakness). COT data shows the net result of all these positions, not the underlying reasons for each.
For equity futures specifically:
1 Net long at a high percentile indicates elevated speculative optimism about equity prices
2 Net short is rare for the major indices over multi-year periods — sustained net short positioning in S&P 500 futures typically only occurs during severe bear markets
3 Rapid moves from long to short represent a meaningful shift in institutional conviction
Left: current net positions for all five markets. Right: 104-week history showing the inverse relationship between S&P 500 positioning (blue) and VIX positioning (red dashed). When equity longs build, VIX longs collapse — and vice versa.
The Four Equity Indices: Size and Style Differences
S&P 500 (ES) is the benchmark. It has the highest open interest and represents the broadest measure of large-cap US equity sentiment. Most cross-market analysis references S&P 500 positioning first.
Nasdaq 100 (NQ) has high correlation with the S&P 500 but is more heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks. When Nasdaq positioning reaches a higher percentile than S&P 500 positioning, it suggests speculative enthusiasm is concentrated in the tech sector. Divergences between ES and NQ positioning are worth noting.
Dow Jones (YM) is the smallest of the three large-cap futures in terms of open interest. Its COT data is less institutionally representative and tends to have noisier week-to-week moves. We track it for completeness but treat it as a secondary signal.
Russell 2000 (RTY) represents small-cap US equities. Positioning here often diverges from the S&P 500 during periods where investors are rotating between large and small caps. Extreme net short positioning in Russell 2000 alongside neutral S&P 500 positioning can indicate selective pessimism about smaller companies rather than broad equity bearishness.
VIX Futures: The Inverse Relationship
VIX futures measure positioning on the CBOE Volatility Index — often called the "fear gauge." Because VIX rises when equity markets fall and falls when markets are calm, VIX positioning behaves inversely to equity positioning.
A net short VIX position means speculators expect volatility to remain low — they are effectively selling insurance against large market moves. This correlates with a bullish equity sentiment backdrop.
A net long VIX position means speculators expect volatility to rise — a bearish or defensive stance.
The visual chart on this page shows the inverse relationship clearly: when S&P 500 net long positioning builds, VIX net positioning tends to fall (or stay short). When equity positioning unwinds, VIX positioning often shifts toward net long as traders buy protection.
Monitoring both together provides a more complete picture of institutional risk appetite than looking at either in isolation.
Interpreting Equity Index Extremes
Because US equities have experienced a multi-decade uptrend, the distribution of speculative positioning is skewed positive. Long-term net long readings are the norm rather than the exception for the S&P 500. This means:
1 A 90th percentile net long in S&P 500 is notable but not shocking in the context of a bull market
2 A net short reading at any percentile is structurally unusual and worth examining
3 The most informative readings are rapid direction changes — large-week shifts from high long percentile to lower percentile, or vice versa
For the Russell 2000 and VIX, the distribution is less skewed. Extreme readings in these markets can be more informative because both markets regularly show net positions on either side of zero.
Cross-Index Patterns Worth Watching
S&P 500 and Nasdaq diverging: If Nasdaq positioning is at 90th percentile while S&P 500 is at 55th, it suggests concentrated tech-specific optimism. If the situation reverses (S&P long, Nasdaq neutral or short), it suggests defensive rotation — large caps favoured over tech.
Russell 2000 versus large caps: When Russell 2000 positioning is significantly more bearish (lower percentile) than S&P 500 positioning, it can indicate macro caution — small caps are more sensitive to domestic credit conditions and economic slowdowns than the multi-national companies dominating the S&P 500.
VIX net long alongside net long equities: This is a unusual configuration. It suggests speculators are simultaneously bullish on equities but buying volatility protection — a hedged risk-on stance rather than pure conviction long.
What Equity Index COT Data Cannot Tell You
It does not capture actual equity ownership. COT futures positioning reflects derivatives, not physical stock holdings. Mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies holding trillions in equities do not appear in this data unless they use CME futures specifically.
It reflects Tuesday closing positions. The report is released on Friday but reflects positions as of the prior Tuesday. For equity markets, which can move significantly on major earnings, Fed decisions, or economic data between Tuesday and Friday, the data may already be stale when published.
Passive and systematic flows dominate. A large portion of equity futures positioning reflects trend-following CTAs and quantitative strategies rather than fundamental views. These strategies build long positions when prices are rising and exit when prices fall — which can make extreme long positions coincide with high prices (late-cycle) rather than cheap prices.

Understanding COT Data for FX (Currency) Markets
Feb 17, 2026
Market Guides
Currency futures are the most actively followed category in the COT report. Fund managers, macro traders, and analysts use CFTC positioning data to gauge whether large speculators are building or unwinding directional bets on major currencies.
This guide covers the nine FX markets in our dashboard, explains how the commitment of traders report forex data is structured, and clarifies a few quirks specific to currency positioning.

9 Limitations Specific to FX
The Nine Currency Pairs We Track
All nine pairs are CME-listed futures. Each is quoted as units of the foreign currency versus the US Dollar.
Symbol Market CFTC Code Typical Contract Size EUR Euro FX 099741 125,000 EUR GBP British Pound 096742 62,500 GBP JPY Japanese Yen 097741 12,500,000 JPY CAD Canadian Dollar 090741 100,000 CAD CHF Swiss Franc 092741 125,000 CHF AUD Australian Dollar 232741 100,000 AUD MXN Mexican Peso 095741 500,000 MXN BRL Brazilian Real 102741 100,000 BRL NZD New Zealand Dollar 112741 100,000 NZD
EUR and JPY are the most widely watched. The EUR has the highest open interest among G10 pairs. The JPY frequently produces the most dramatic positioning swings.
How FX COT Positioning Works
All currency futures on the CME are quoted against the US Dollar. A net long position in EUR futures means non-commercial traders hold more buy contracts (long EUR / short USD) than sell contracts (short EUR / long USD).
This creates an embedded USD relationship in every FX positioning reading.
Every long position in a currency future is simultaneously a short on USD. Reading multiple pairs together gives an aggregate picture of USD sentiment.
For example:
1 Net long EUR + net long GBP + net long AUD all point in the same direction: dollar bearishness.
2 If the JPY is simultaneously net short, it partially offsets the implied dollar picture (being short JPY means being long dollars on that leg).
Reading currency positioning in isolation has limited value. Looking at the pattern across all nine pairs gives a clearer picture of aggregate USD sentiment at any given time.
The Commercial vs Non-Commercial Split in FX
In commodity markets, commercial traders are typically producers or end-users hedging physical exposure. In currency markets, the distinction is less clean.
Commercial traders in FX include:
1 Multinational corporations hedging foreign revenue
2 Banks managing currency exposure from international operations
3 Asset managers with known foreign currency liabilities
Non-commercial traders include:
1 Macro hedge funds with directional currency views
2 Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) running trend-following strategies
3 Proprietary trading firms
We focus on non-commercial positioning because it represents the speculative, directional part of the market. Commercial hedgers tend to move in response to business needs. Speculative positioning reflects market expectations.
What the Data Looks Like: A Snapshot
Illustrative snapshot. Green bars = net long (bullish currency, bearish USD). Red bars = net short (bearish currency, bullish USD). Percentile labels show where each reading sits versus the 104-week history.
A few things to note:
1 The absolute size of bars is not directly comparable across currencies. A 95,000 contract short in JPY does not equal a 95,000 contract short in EUR in notional USD terms, because contract sizes differ.
2 What matters more is the percentile rank — where that position sits relative to historical norms for that specific pair.
3 When multiple pairs simultaneously show readings above the 80th percentile (long) or below the 20th percentile (short), it is a sign of broad-based USD directional consensus among large speculators.
Per-Pair Breakdown
Each currency has its own positioning characteristics. Below is a brief profile of what to watch in each market.
EUR/USD — Euro FX COT Report
The EUR/USD COT report is the most closely watched FX positioning dataset. The Euro future has the highest open interest of any currency pair and effectively functions as the inverse of the DXY (US Dollar Index) in speculative positioning terms.
Extreme net long EUR readings generally indicate a consensus dollar-bearish view among large speculators. Extreme net short readings indicate the reverse. Because EUR dominates the DXY basket (~58% weight), EUR COT data is often used as a proxy for overall USD sentiment.
CFTC Code: 099741 | Contract size: 125,000 EUR
GBP/USD — British Pound COT Report
GBP positioning tends to be more volatile than EUR, reflecting the pound's sensitivity to UK-specific political and economic events. The GBP COT report is useful for tracking how speculators are positioned around Bank of England policy shifts and domestic macro data.
Net positions in GBP are typically smaller in absolute contract terms than EUR, but percentage moves in positioning can be larger. Watch for divergences between EUR and GBP positioning — when EUR is net long but GBP is net short, speculators are differentiating between EU and UK outlooks.
CFTC Code: 096742 | Contract size: 62,500 GBP
JPY/USD — Japanese Yen COT Report
The JPY COT report is particularly useful for tracking carry trade positioning. The Yen frequently shows the most extreme short positioning of any G10 currency during periods of low global volatility, when speculators borrow in low-rate currencies to fund higher-yielding positions elsewhere.
When risk appetite deteriorates sharply, JPY shorts unwind rapidly. Extreme net short Yen readings — above the 90th percentile — are watched closely by macro traders as a potential crowding indicator.
CFTC Code: 097741 | Contract size: 12,500,000 JPY
AUD/USD — Australian Dollar COT Report
The AUD COT report is one of three commodity currency pairs alongside CAD and NZD. Australian Dollar positioning correlates with commodity sentiment, particularly metals and mining. Net long AUD readings often coincide with periods of positive risk appetite and rising commodity prices.
Watch AUD positioning alongside CAD and NZD. When all three move in the same direction, it usually reflects a broad commodity or risk theme rather than an Australia-specific view.
CFTC Code: 232741 | Contract size: 100,000 AUD
CAD/USD — Canadian Dollar COT Report
CAD positioning is heavily influenced by crude oil prices, given Canada's status as a major oil exporter. The Canadian Dollar COT report is useful for cross-referencing against crude oil COT data — if crude oil speculators are net long but CAD speculators are net short simultaneously, that is a divergence worth examining.
CAD tends to have lower absolute positioning levels than EUR or JPY but can show sharp week-over-week changes around Bank of Canada decisions or oil supply events.
CFTC Code: 090741 | Contract size: 100,000 CAD
CHF/USD — Swiss Franc COT Report
CHF is a safe-haven currency. Swiss Franc COT positioning tends to build net longs during periods of global stress and unwind during risk-on periods. This makes the CHF COT report a useful cross-check against equity and bond positioning.
Extreme net long CHF readings are relatively rare outside of genuine risk-off environments. When they appear, they indicate that large speculators are seeking defensive positioning.
CFTC Code: 092741 | Contract size: 125,000 CHF
NZD/USD — New Zealand Dollar COT Report
NZD behaves similarly to AUD and often moves in tandem. The New Zealand Dollar COT report is most useful when NZD and AUD diverge — this can reflect specific Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy expectations or NZ-specific data deviating from the broader commodity currency trend.
NZD has the smallest open interest of the G10 pairs we track. Absolute position sizes are smaller, and percentage positioning moves can be more extreme.
CFTC Code: 112741 | Contract size: 100,000 NZD
MXN and BRL — Emerging Market Pairs
The Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real COT reports follow a different pattern than G10 pairs. Both are classified as emerging market currencies with lower liquidity.
Key differences:
1 Positioning extremes can persist longer. EM carry trades are slower to unwind than G10 positions.
2 Unwinding is faster when it happens. When EM risk sentiment shifts, MXN and BRL positioning can move sharply in a single week.
3 US-Mexico and US-Brazil relations influence MXN and BRL positioning independently of broader USD trends.
We track both pairs on the dashboard but apply extra caution when interpreting extremes relative to G10 pairs.
MXN CFTC Code: 095741 | Contract size: 500,000 MXN BRL CFTC Code: 102741 | Contract size: 100,000 BRL
Historical Patterns in FX Positioning
A few recurring patterns are worth understanding when conducting COT analysis for forex markets:
The JPY carry trade signal. The Yen often shows the most extreme short positioning of any G10 currency during low-volatility periods. When risk appetite deteriorates, JPY shorts unwind rapidly. Net short Yen readings above the 95th percentile have historically coincided with crowded carry positioning.
Euro as proxy for dollar sentiment. EUR is the largest currency future by open interest and effectively acts as the inverse of the DXY in positioning terms. Extreme net long EUR generally reflects a consensus dollar-bearish view.
Commodity currency correlation. AUD, CAD, and NZD tend to show correlated positioning during commodity cycles. All three may build long positions simultaneously during commodity booms and flip together during downturns.
EM pair caution. MXN and BRL have lower liquidity than G7 pairs. Positioning extremes in these two can persist longer and unwind faster than in the majors.
Reading Extremes in FX
Extreme percentile readings — 95th or above, 5th or below — in currency markets are worth noting, but come with a caveat: FX trends can last longer than positioning models suggest.
A 99th percentile net short in JPY might reflect a multi-year structural theme such as an ongoing interest rate differential, rather than a crowded trade about to reverse. Context matters.
What extreme FX readings are more reliably useful for:
1 Identifying when a trend has attracted maximum speculative participation
2 Spotting divergences between two correlated pairs (e.g., AUD and NZD moving in opposite directions)
3 Comparing current extremes against previous instances of similar readings
What they are less useful for:
1 Timing reversals with precision
2 Trading against a strong macro trend supported by fundamentals
How We Report FX Data
In the dashboard, FX pairs are listed as a group under the "FX" category filter. Each row shows:
1 Net position (non-commercial long minus short, in contracts)
2 Weekly change (net change from the prior report)
3 Open interest (total outstanding contracts, all trader types)
In our weekly COT report analysis, FX positioning receives its own section with percentile ranks and comparisons to moving averages across all nine pairs.
Limitations Specific to FX Data
Cross-rate implications are not shown. Our data shows each pair versus USD only. EUR/JPY or AUD/JPY positioning is not available directly from the legacy COT report.
Spot and OTC FX is not included. The CFTC report covers regulated futures only. The much larger over-the-counter FX market — banks, retail brokers — is not reported here.
Contract size differences. Comparing notional positioning across pairs requires adjusting for contract size and current exchange rates. The dashboard shows contract counts, not notional USD values.

Understanding COT Data for Grains & Softs Markets
Feb 15, 2026
Market Guides
Agricultural futures are the most diverse category in the COT report. The twelve markets we track span four sub-groups — grains, oilseeds, tropical softs, and livestock — each with its own positioning drivers. Seasonal patterns are stronger here than in any other asset class.
This guide covers all twelve markets, explains how they cluster into meaningful sub-groups, and highlights what makes agricultural COT data different from financial or metals positioning.
The Twelve Agricultural Markets We Track
Symbol Market CFTC Code Exchange Sub-Group C Corn 002602 CBOT Grains S Soybeans 005602 CBOT Oilseeds W Wheat (SRW) 001602 CBOT Grains KW Wheat (HRW) 001612 CBOT Grains SM Soybean Meal 026603 CBOT Oilseeds BO Soybean Oil 007601 CBOT Oilseeds SB Sugar #11 080732 ICE Softs KC Coffee C 083731 ICE Softs CC Cocoa 073732 ICE Softs LE Live Cattle 057642 CME Livestock HE Lean Hogs 054642 CME Livestock GF Feeder Cattle 061641 CME Livestock
The three grain/oilseed futures (Corn, Soybeans, Wheat) have the highest open interest and institutional coverage. Coffee and Cocoa are the most followed softs internationally.
Why Seasonality Matters in Agricultural COT Data
Agricultural commodities follow planting and harvest calendars. These calendars create predictable windows of positioning activity that simply do not exist in financial markets or metals.
Corn and Soybeans follow the North American crop year:
1 Planting season (April–June) creates uncertainty around acreage
2 Summer growing season (July–August) is the most weather-sensitive period
3 Harvest pressure (September–November) typically weighs on prices
4 Speculative long positioning often peaks in late winter/spring (before the crop is established) and fades as harvest approaches
Wheat has two distinct crops tracked here: Soft Red Winter (SRW) planted in autumn and harvested early summer, and Hard Red Winter (HRW) with a similar but slightly different schedule. Speculative positioning in both wheat contracts often converges, but export competitiveness (US vs Australian vs Black Sea wheat) can cause divergence.
Left: current net positions for all 12 markets. Right: illustrative seasonal positioning bias patterns — green triangles suggest historically stronger net long periods, red inverted triangles suggest net short periods, dashes indicate neutral. This is a general pattern, not a forecast.
Grains: Corn, Wheat, and the Soybean Complex
Corn is the largest agricultural futures market by open interest. Net short positions in Corn are common and can be very large during periods of ample supply or weak export demand. A net short Corn position at the 5th percentile is a genuine extreme. A net short at the 30th percentile is unremarkable.
Soybeans, Soybean Meal, and Soybean Oil are closely linked — they are three products from the same crop, connected by crush margins (the spread between raw beans and processed products). When the crush margin is attractive, processors buy beans and sell meal and oil simultaneously. This can create divergent COT signals within the soybean complex that reflect processing economics rather than directional views on beans alone.
Wheat (SRW and HRW) positioning is frequently influenced by export flows and supply disruptions in major producing regions. The two wheat contracts usually move together but can diverge when quality or regional availability differs. Both are tracked separately because their positioning signals can occasionally conflict.
Softs: Sugar, Coffee, and Cocoa
The three ICE-traded softs each have distinct global supply dynamics.
Sugar #11 is driven by the Brazilian crop (the world's largest producer), monsoon patterns in India, and ethanol economics (in Brazil, sugar cane is diverted to ethanol when energy prices rise). Sugar positioning can swing dramatically around Brazilian harvest news.
Coffee C (Arabica) is sensitive to Brazilian and Colombian weather. Frosts in the Brazilian coffee belt are the classic supply shock that historically triggers rapid short-covering. Coffee positioning has shown some of the most persistent multi-year net short trends in the dataset when supply is ample, making extreme short readings worth contextualising carefully.
Cocoa supply is concentrated in West Africa, primarily Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Political instability or dry weather in these regions can quickly shift Cocoa COT positioning. Cocoa is also a relatively small market — net position moves of 10,000–20,000 contracts represent a meaningful percentage of total open interest.
Livestock: Cattle and Hogs
The three livestock futures (Live Cattle, Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs) behave differently from grain and soft markets.
Live Cattle and Feeder Cattle are closely related — feeder cattle are young animals that will eventually become slaughter-weight live cattle. Their positioning tends to move together but can diverge when feed costs (driven by Corn and Soybean prices) shift the economics of feeding cattle.
Cattle positioning is more driven by domestic US consumption patterns and packing capacity than by international trade. Speculative positioning is generally less extreme in cattle than in grains, and percentile readings tend to cluster in the 30–70th range rather than reaching consistent extremes.
Lean Hogs has more volatile positioning than cattle, partly due to export demand (US pork is heavily exported to China) and partly due to disease events that can abruptly shift supply. Hog positioning can move from mid-range to extreme readings quickly following news of disease outbreaks or large US-China trade developments.
How Agricultural Positioning Reads Together
Agricultural COT data is most useful when read at the sub-group level.
Grains all at 10th percentile or below: Indicates broad pessimism about the grain complex — possibly driven by large supplies, strong harvest, or weak export demand. All three being simultaneously bearish is a stronger signal than one market in isolation.
Softs diverging: Coffee net short while Cocoa net long reflects different regional supply stories rather than a broad "soft commodities view." These markets have independent fundamentals.
Livestock versus grains aligned: When cattle and hog positioning is strong (long) but grain positioning is also long, it creates a potential tension — higher grain prices raise livestock feeding costs. This can compress meat packer margins and eventually weigh on livestock positioning.
A Note on the Weather Premium
Agricultural markets carry a "weather premium" in speculative positioning that no other asset class has to the same degree. Drought, frost, and flood risk cause traders to build long positions as insurance against supply shortfalls. This means:
1 A high percentile reading may reflect genuine supply concern, not just crowded speculation
2 When weather risk dissipates (e.g., a good crop condition report), speculative longs unwind rapidly
3 Comparing COT extremes to the actual crop condition data is more informative than reading COT in isolation
Limitations Specific to Agricultural Markets
Seasonal adjustment is not applied. Our percentile rankings compare all historical weeks equally — a January week is ranked against other January weeks and against July weeks. Seasonal patterns mean that a 75th percentile net long in May (pre-crop concern) may be structurally normal, whereas the same reading in November (post-harvest) is more unusual.
Weather is unobservable in the data. COT data reflects positioning taken in response to weather expectations, but the expectations themselves are not visible. Positioning can look extreme purely because of a specific drought or flood event that may or may not persist.
Export demand is US-focused. US-listed grain futures reflect American export competitiveness. When the dollar strengthens, US grain exports become more expensive globally, which can suppress positioning independently of supply conditions.

Understanding COT Data for Metals Markets
Feb 15, 2026
Market Guides
Metals futures are among the most closely watched categories in the COT report. Gold in particular routinely generates the most extreme percentile readings of any market in the dataset — it is not unusual for speculative positioning to reach 95th percentile or above during periods of macro stress.
This guide covers the four metals futures we track, how they differ from one another, and how to interpret positioning data in this category.
The Four Metals We Track
All four are COMEX or NYMEX-listed futures. Contract specifications vary significantly, which matters when comparing absolute net position numbers.
Symbol Market CFTC Code Contract Size Exchange GC Gold 088691 100 troy oz COMEX SI Silver 084691 5,000 troy oz COMEX HG Copper 085692 25,000 lbs COMEX PL Platinum 076651 50 troy oz NYMEX
Gold has by far the largest open interest and is the most liquid. Platinum is the smallest of the four and can show thinner positioning data.
Precious vs Industrial: A Key Distinction
The four metals split into two groups with different positioning drivers.
Precious metals (Gold, Silver) attract speculative positioning primarily based on:
1 Macro and monetary policy expectations (real interest rates, dollar direction)
2 Inflation and safe-haven demand
3 Risk-off events and geopolitical stress
Industrial metals (Copper, and to a degree Platinum) attract positioning based on:
1 Global growth expectations
2 Manufacturing and construction activity
3 Supply disruption risk
This means Gold and Copper can move in opposite directions even within the same week. A strong US jobs report might push Gold positioning lower (higher rates = less appeal) while supporting Copper positioning (growth = more demand).
Reading both precious and industrial metals positioning together provides more information than reading either in isolation.
Left: current net positions with percentile ranks. Right: 104-week position history for Gold and Silver, showing how positioning trends over a full cycle.
Gold: The Benchmark Metals Position
Gold is the highest-volume precious metals future and the one most watched by macro analysts. Its COT positioning has a few well-documented characteristics:
Large absolute swings. Gold net long positions can range from near zero to over 300,000 contracts across a full cycle. This is a wide range, and context matters.
Strong correlation with real yields. When US real interest rates (nominal yields minus inflation expectations) fall, speculative Gold longs tend to build. When real rates rise, they tend to unwind. This is not a rule, but a pattern worth knowing.
Crowding risk at extremes. When Gold positioning reaches 95th percentile or above, it indicates that speculative participation is near its historical peak. This does not mean a reversal is imminent, but it does mean there are fewer new buyers to push the position higher.
Silver: High Volatility, Smaller Base
Silver positioning moves directionally with Gold, but the base of open interest is smaller. This creates sharper percentage moves in the COT data when sentiment shifts.
Silver is also a partially industrial metal — it has significant use in solar panels and electronics. This can cause Silver positioning to diverge from Gold during periods where industrial demand expectations shift independently of macro conditions.
A useful observation: when Silver positioning reaches a higher percentile than Gold simultaneously, it often reflects stronger momentum in the metals complex.
Copper: The Economic Barometer
Copper has no safe-haven component. Its positioning reflects almost entirely the market's view on global economic activity — primarily driven by Chinese demand, which accounts for roughly half of global copper consumption.
When speculative Copper positioning moves to extreme net long, it typically means macro traders expect strong global growth. When it moves to extreme net short, they expect a slowdown.
Copper positioning is therefore worth comparing against equity index positioning. Aligned signals (both bullish or both bearish) represent a consistent macro picture. Divergences between the two deserve attention.
Platinum: Smaller Market, Different Dynamics
Platinum sits between precious and industrial in its demand profile. It is used in catalytic converters and hydrogen fuel cells, but also held as a store of value in some markets.
Open interest is materially lower than Gold or Silver, which means:
1 Positioning extremes can be reached with smaller absolute contract numbers
2 The data can be noisier week to week
3 Fewer institutional participants means the positioning is less representative of broad macro consensus
We track Platinum because it is a CFTC-reported NYMEX future, but treat its signals with more caution than the other three.
How Metals Positioning Reads Together
The most useful way to read metals COT data is to look at the pattern across all four markets simultaneously.
A scenario worth noting: Gold and Silver both at 90th+ percentile, Copper at 40th percentile. This would suggest a flight-to-safety drive rather than a broad industrial-demand driven rally. The opposite configuration — Gold flat, Copper high — would suggest growth optimism without safe-haven demand.
These cross-market patterns are covered in weekly blog posts alongside percentile rankings.
Limitations Specific to Metals
Leverage and ETF flows are separate. Large Gold ETF inflows (e.g., GLD) represent physical demand, not futures speculation. COT data does not capture ETF positioning. It is possible for ETF holdings to rise while futures speculation falls, or vice versa.
Seasonality is weak. Unlike agricultural markets, metals do not follow strong seasonal planting or harvest cycles. Some mild seasonal patterns exist (e.g., jewellery demand ahead of certain holidays), but they are not reliable enough to use as a standalone indicator.
Contract sizes make notional comparison difficult. A 10,000-contract net long in Gold (100 oz each = 1,000,000 oz) is a much larger notional position than 10,000 contracts in Platinum (50 oz each = 500,000 oz). Always consider contract size when comparing across markets.

Using CoT Data to Spot Reversals
FF Research Team | Jan 18, 2026 | 12 min read
Learn to identify overcrowded trades using z-scores, positioning divergences, and the 'flip' signal — a step-by-step framework for spotting institutional liquidation setups.
Every trend runs on fuel. In currencies and commodities that fuel is speculative capital — hedge funds, CTAs, and leveraged money piling into one direction. Most retail traders try to guess when a trend has topped. Professionals don't guess — they measure how much fuel is left, and they start paying attention when the tank is running low.
The tool for measuring that fuel is the Commitment of Traders (COT) report, published every Friday by the CFTC. If you're not familiar with the different reports and which one to use, start with our guide on COT Report Explained: Why Most Traders Read It Wrong. This article assumes you know the basics and focuses entirely on the practical question: how do you use positioning data to spot when a trend is vulnerable to reversal?
The Overcrowded Trade
A trend persists as long as new money keeps entering. But every trend has a saturation point — a moment when the vast majority of speculative capital is already committed. When there is no marginal buyer left, the market becomes structurally fragile. Any catalyst — a surprising data release, a shift in central bank tone — can trigger a rapid unwind.
This is not a prediction based on gut feeling. It is a structural observation: when positioning is stretched to a statistical extreme, the risk of a sharp counter-move rises dramatically. That does not mean a reversal is guaranteed — Gold, for example, has sustained extreme long positioning for months during strong fundamental uptrends. But it means the market is vulnerable, and the risk/reward for blindly following the trend deteriorates.
Healthy Trend
New capital entering each week. Net positioning growing steadily. Price moves are supported by fresh flows. The trend has fuel.
Vulnerable Trend
Positioning at a statistical extreme. Weekly additions shrinking or reversing. Price may still be rising, but on momentum fumes — the risk of a snap-back is elevated.
The FLIP Percentile: One Number That Tells You Everything
The traditional way to measure positioning extremes is the z-score — how many standard deviations current positioning is from its historical mean. A z-score beyond ±2.0 flags a statistical extreme (a reading that occurs less than 2.5% of the time). This is useful, but numbers like "+2.3 standard deviations" are not intuitive for fast decision-making.
That is why we built the FLIP Percentile — a single, normalized gauge from 0% to 100% that instantly tells you where hedge fund positioning sits relative to its entire historical range. No spreadsheets, no formulas, no interpretation needed:
1 100% — Maximum bullish positioning. Hedge funds have never been more long in the lookback window.
2 0% — Maximum bearish positioning. Hedge funds have never been more short.
3 50% — Neutral midpoint. Positioning is unremarkable.
The Key Thresholds
Above 80% or below 20% = elevated risk zone. This is where the trade is getting crowded. It does not mean "short it now" — it means stop trend-following on autopilot and start watching for the confirming signals described below. Think of it as shifting from cruise control to high alert.
FLIP Percentile Signal Level What It Means Action 90% – 100% Extreme bullish Near record-long. Very little marginal buying power left. Actively watch for bearish reversal signals 80% – 90% Elevated bullish Positioning stretched. Trend can continue, but risk is rising. Tighten stops, avoid adding to longs 20% – 80% Neutral Positioning is unremarkable. No crowding signal. Trade normally — COT is not a factor 10% – 20% Elevated bearish Positioning stretched short. Short-squeeze risk is rising. Tighten stops, avoid adding to shorts 0% – 10% Extreme bearish Near record-short. Very little marginal selling power left. Actively watch for bullish reversal signals
On the Forex Fundamentals platform, the FLIP Percentile is plotted as a time-series chart with dashed threshold lines at 20% and 80%. One glance tells you whether a currency or commodity is in the danger zone — no CSV downloads, no formulas, no guesswork.
The Four Reversal Signals
The FLIP Percentile tells you when to pay attention. The next step is looking for a confirming signal — the evidence that the unwind has actually begun. These are the four most reliable patterns, and each one maps directly to a chart on the platform:
Signal 1: Price-Positioning Divergence
The highest-probability reversal signal. Price continues to make new highs (or lows), but hedge fund positioning starts to decline. The "smart money" is quietly exiting even as price pushes further — the trend is surviving on retail momentum, not institutional conviction.
Where to See It
Open the Longs & Shorts Over Time chart. This shows the absolute contract counts for long and short positions. Watch for the lines to start converging (longs declining, shorts rising) while price continues in the original direction. That is your divergence — and it is often the first crack in the trend.
Signal 2: The "Flip" — Net Position Reversal
A "flip" is when hedge funds cross from net long to net short (or vice versa). This is the most decisive signal — it represents a genuine change in institutional conviction, not just trimming. The money that was driving the trend has now switched sides entirely.
Where to See It
The Long vs Short Bias chart makes flips visually obvious. It shows the percentage split between longs and shorts, normalized to 100%. When you see the green (long) and red (short) areas swap dominance — that is a flip. A 70/30 split or more in either direction indicates strong directional bias; watch for it to reverse.
Signal 3: Rapid Unwind
Sometimes a reversal doesn't come with a dramatic flip. Instead, you see a sharp, multi-week reduction in net positioning. If hedge funds go from net long 120,000 contracts to 45,000 in three weeks — a 62% unwind — the trend is clearly losing institutional backing, even though they are still technically "long."
Where to See It
The Total Volume (Open Interest) chart confirms this pattern. Rising OI with rising prices validates a trend. But when OI starts declining while price pushes higher — or when you see a sudden drop in open contracts — it signals that money is leaving the trade. The trend is running on decreasing participation.
Signal 4: Extreme Positioning + Fundamental Shift
The most powerful setup combines positioning vulnerability with a change in the fundamental story. If hedge funds are record long USD and then inflation unexpectedly drops — giving the Fed room to cut rates — you have both the structural fragility (overcrowded) and the catalyst (fundamental shift) for a sharp move.
Important Nuance
Extreme positioning is not a sell signal by itself. It is a risk condition. Gold has spent extended periods with FLIP Percentile above 80% during strong fundamental uptrends — and kept going. The difference is whether the fundamental backdrop supports the extreme positioning or is shifting against it. COT data tells you where the risk is. The fundamentals tell you whether that risk is about to be realized.
Worked Example: EUR/USD Reversal Setup
Here is how the framework plays out in a realistic scenario — the kind of setup you can identify every week using the platform's charts:
Scenario: Bearish EUR/USD Reversal
Week 1: Leveraged Money net long EUR at +82,000 contracts. FLIP Percentile: 94%. EUR/USD at 1.1280. The FLIP Percentile chart is deep in the red zone — you add EUR to your watchlist and stop adding to longs.
Week 2: EUR/USD pushes to 1.1325 (new high), but on the Longs & Shorts chart you see the green line (longs) drop to +71,000. The FLIP Percentile rolls over to 85%. Price up, positioning down — divergence confirmed.
Week 3: US CPI surprises hot. The Fed is less likely to cut. On the Long vs Short Bias chart, the green bar collapses from ~75% to ~55%. FLIP Percentile crashes to 52%. EUR/USD breaks below 1.1200 support. All criteria met: extreme → divergence → fundamental catalyst → technical break.
Result: High-conviction short EUR/USD. The hedge fund unwind provides the fuel, the fundamental shift provides the direction, the technical break provides the entry.
Common Mistakes
Mistake 1: Fading Trends Too Early
The most common error is seeing a high FLIP Percentile and immediately going contrarian. Positioning can stay extreme — and become more extreme — for weeks or even months. Gold has proven this repeatedly: sustained fundamental drivers (central bank buying, geopolitical risk) can keep positioning elevated far longer than any contrarian model would suggest. An extreme FLIP reading is a risk warning, not an entry signal. Always wait for confirmation.
Mistake 2: Ignoring the Fundamental Context
If hedge funds are aggressively long USD while the Fed is actively hiking rates, the extreme is fundamentally justified. Positioning against a strong fundamental trend is a recipe for destruction. COT reversals work best when the fundamentals are shifting — when the story that justified the crowded trade starts to crack. Always ask: is the fundamental driver still intact?
Mistake 3: Using the Wrong Report
The Legacy report's "Non-Commercial" category mixes hedge funds with asset managers, diluting the signal. For reversal analysis, precision matters. Use the TFF report (Leveraged Money) for forex and the Disaggregated report (Managed Money) for commodities. Our COT Report guide covers this in detail.
Mistake 4: Treating COT as a Timing Tool
COT data reflects positions as of Tuesday, but is released on Friday. That is a 3-day lag. In a fast market, a lot can change. More importantly, COT data tells you who is positioned where — it does not tell you when they will exit. This is why COT analysis is best suited for swing trading — multi-day to multi-week horizons — and should always be combined with technical confirmation for entry timing. Treat it as strategic context, not a day-trading trigger.
Stop Guessing, Start Measuring
You can download the CFTC reports yourself, import them into a spreadsheet, calculate z-scores and percentile rankings manually, and cross-reference everything with price charts. Or you can open Forex Fundamentals and read it off a dashboard in seconds.
The FLIP Percentile, the Long vs Short Bias, the Open Interest trends, the Longs & Shorts chart — every tool you need to run the reversal framework is updated automatically, every week. The question is not whether COT data gives you an edge. It does. The question is whether you want to spend your Fridays in Excel, or spend them trading.
Put these concepts into practice.

What Are Percentile Rankings in COT Data?
Feb 11, 2026
Methodology
Percentile rankings are how we convert raw contract numbers into a meaningful, comparable score. Without them, knowing that non-commercial traders hold 245,000 net long Gold contracts tells you very little. With a percentile rank, that same number becomes: this is larger than 99% of all recorded weeks.
This page explains the methodology behind percentile rankings, how to interpret them, and their limitations.
What a Percentile Rank Tells You
A percentile rank answers one question: Where does this week's position sit relative to the full historical record?
1 A 99th percentile reading means the current position is larger than 99 out of 100 historical weeks.
2 A 1st percentile reading means it is smaller than 99 out of 100 historical weeks.
3 A 50th percentile reading means it sits exactly in the middle of the range.
The number itself is not a signal. It is a description of how unusual the positioning is right now compared to what has been normal historically.
How We Calculate It
The calculation is straightforward. For each market and each report week:
1 Collect all non-commercial net positions from the historical database (up to 104 weeks).
2 Sort those values from lowest to highest.
3 Count how many historical values fall at or below the current value.
4 Divide that count by the total number of historical weeks, then multiply by 100.
If 99 out of 100 historical weeks had a lower net position than today, the percentile rank is 99.
We apply a half-unit correction (subtracting 0.5 before dividing) to avoid returning exactly 0 or 100 for non-extreme values. Ranks are then capped between 1 and 99.
Distribution of historical net positions and the corresponding percentile zones. The current position (dashed green line) falls in the extreme-high zone.
The Five Zones
For practical reading, we group percentile ranks into five zones:
Zone Percentile Range What It Means Extreme Low 0–5th Position near the lowest on historical record Below Average 5–25th Lighter positioning than usual Mid-Range 25–75th No statistically unusual positioning Above Average 75–95th Heavier positioning than usual Extreme High 95–100th Position near the highest on historical record
Mid-range readings (25–75th) carry no particular analytical weight. Extreme readings (≤5th or ≥95th) indicate that positioning has become stretched relative to history.
How Many Weeks of Data Do We Need?
Percentile rankings become more meaningful as the historical database grows. Here is how confidence scales with data availability:
Under 13 weeks: Rankings are descriptive only. We report directional bands (e.g., "upper quartile") rather than precise percentiles, because the sample is too small to be reliable.
13–52 weeks: Rankings are moderately reliable. Useful for identifying early trends, but extreme readings can be artefacts of a limited window.
52+ weeks (1 year): Rankings become statistically robust. At this point, a 95th percentile reading genuinely reflects an unusual position in the context of a full market cycle.
104 weeks (2 years): Our target baseline. Most markets go through at least one complete positioning cycle within two years, so the full range is reasonably well represented.
Reading the Percentile Table
The dashboard and weekly blog posts display a summary table. Here is how to read a row:
Each row shows the net position, percentile rank, zone colour, and a proportional bar for quick visual comparison.
The rank bar at the right of each row is proportional: a 99th percentile reading nearly fills the bar; a 10th percentile reading is a thin strip on the left.
What Percentile Rankings Do Not Tell You
Percentile rankings describe positioning. They do not:
1 Predict price direction. An extreme position can persist for weeks or reverse the following day.
2 Indicate a specific reversal point. Markets can reach a 95th percentile and then extend further to 98th or 99th before any change occurs.
3 Account for structural shifts. If overall market participation grows significantly (e.g., a new instrument gaining adoption), the historical range may no longer be representative.
4 Replace fundamental analysis. A stretched short position in Yen may reflect a sustained macro theme rather than a mean-reversion opportunity.
Treat them as a lens on relative positioning, not a trading signal.
Z-Scores: A Complementary Measure
Alongside percentile ranks, we also calculate Z-scores for markets with 52+ weeks of history.
A Z-score measures how many standard deviations the current position is from the historical mean:
1 Z-score of 0 = exactly at the historical average
2 Z-score of +2 = two standard deviations above average (unusual)
3 Z-score of −2 = two standard deviations below average (unusual)
Z-scores and percentile ranks tend to agree. When they diverge — for example, a 96th percentile rank with a Z-score of only 1.4 — it usually means the distribution is skewed. The actual position is near a historical extreme, but not dramatically far from the mean in absolute terms.
A Note on Changing Baselines
Our percentile rankings are calculated against the weeks stored in the database, which currently spans up to 104 weeks. As new data is added each week, older weeks drop off and the baseline shifts.
This means a reading of "72nd percentile" this week might become "68th percentile" next week, even if the position itself did not change — simply because the historical window updated.
This is expected behaviour. Percentile ranks are always relative to the available history.

What Is the COT Report? A Trader's Guide to CFTC Futures Positioning Data

What Is the COT Report? A Trader's Guide to CFTC Futures Positioning Data
Every Friday at 3:30 PM Eastern, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) publishes the Commitment of Traders report. It shows how different categories of market participants — hedgers, speculators, and small traders — are positioned across dozens of futures markets.
The data covers everything from crude oil and gold to Treasury bonds and Bitcoin. It is one of the few publicly available windows into institutional positioning.
This guide explains what the report contains, how to interpret it, and where it fits into market analysis.
What the CFTC Actually Publishes
The CFTC collects position data from large futures traders who exceed certain reporting thresholds. It then groups those traders into categories and publishes aggregate totals.
The report comes in several formats:
1 Legacy Report — the original format. Groups traders into Commercial, Non-Commercial, and Non-Reportable. This is the most widely used version and the one we track on our dashboard.
2 Disaggregated Report — breaks down Commercials into Producer/Merchant and Swap Dealers. Breaks down Non-Commercials into Managed Money and Other Reportables.
3 Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) — covers financial contracts only. Uses categories like Dealer/Intermediary, Asset Manager, Leveraged Funds, and Other Reportables.
All three formats use the same underlying data. The difference is how traders get categorised.
For most analysis, the Legacy Report is sufficient. If you need to distinguish between hedge fund activity and pension fund positioning, the Disaggregated or TFF reports add that granularity.
The Three Groups in the Legacy Report
Commercials (Hedgers)
These are businesses that use the physical commodity or financial instrument in their operations. Airlines hedging jet fuel. Miners selling forward production. Banks managing interest rate exposure.
Commercials trade futures to reduce business risk, not to speculate on price direction. Their positions often run counter to the prevailing trend — they sell into rallies and buy into dips because their hedging needs are driven by business operations, not market forecasts.
They are sometimes called "smart money." That label is partly deserved: they know their own industries better than anyone. But their positioning reflects hedging needs, not directional bets.
Non-Commercials (Large Speculators)
Hedge funds. Commodity trading advisors. Asset managers. Anyone trading futures purely for profit who exceeds the CFTC's reporting threshold.
This group is directional. When non-commercial traders are heavily net long, they expect prices to rise. When net short, they expect prices to fall.
Their positioning is the most watched data point in the COT report. Extreme one-sided positioning by this group has historically preceded market turns — though "historically preceded" is doing heavy lifting in that sentence. More on limitations below.
Non-Reportable (Small Traders)
Everyone else. Traders whose positions fall below the CFTC reporting threshold. Calculated as total open interest minus the commercial and non-commercial positions.
This group tends to get less analytical attention. The conventional view is that small traders are less informed, but that generalisation has limits.
Key Terms You Need to Know
Open Interest — the total number of outstanding futures contracts in a market. Not volume (which counts trades), but the number of contracts still open. Rising open interest means new money is entering the market. Falling open interest means positions are being closed.
Net Position — long contracts minus short contracts for a given group. If non-commercials hold 150,000 longs and 80,000 shorts in gold, their net position is +70,000 (net long). This single number is what most COT analysis focuses on.
Long — a position that profits when prices rise.
Short — a position that profits when prices fall.
Reportable vs Non-Reportable — the CFTC sets position thresholds for each market. Traders above the threshold must report. Those below are lumped into "non-reportable."
What Markets Does the COT Report Cover?
The report covers futures traded on U.S. exchanges. The main categories:
1 Currencies — EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, and others
2 Metals — Gold, Silver, Copper, Platinum
3 Energy — Crude Oil (WTI), Natural Gas, Heating Oil, Gasoline
4 Grains & Agriculture — Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Coffee, Cocoa, Sugar, Cotton, Live Cattle, Lean Hogs
5 Equity Indices — S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, VIX
6 Interest Rates — 2-Year, 5-Year, 10-Year, and 30-Year Treasuries
7 Cryptocurrency — Bitcoin and Ethereum futures (added in recent years)
We track 41 markets across these categories. You can view all of them on the interactive dashboard or download the latest data.
When Is the COT Report Released?
The report follows a fixed weekly schedule:
1 Tuesday — the "as of" date. The data reflects positions held at market close on Tuesday.
2 Friday, 3:30 PM ET — the CFTC publishes the report. There is a 3-day lag between the snapshot and the release.
This means by the time you see the data, it is already 3 days old. In fast-moving markets, positioning can shift meaningfully in that window. This lag is the single biggest limitation of COT data.
Occasionally the CFTC delays publication due to holidays. In those weeks, the report typically comes out Monday instead.
Why Traders Pay Attention to COT Data
The COT report does one thing well: it tells you where the big players are positioned right now (or rather, where they were last Tuesday).
That matters for several reasons:
Crowded trades become visible. When non-commercial traders are overwhelmingly positioned in one direction, the market becomes vulnerable to a squeeze or reversal. Not because extreme positioning causes reversals — but because there are fewer new buyers (or sellers) left to push the trend further.
Divergences stand out. If prices are making new highs but speculative net longs are shrinking, that divergence is informational. The trend may be losing conviction.
Sector-level patterns emerge. When all four Treasury maturities show extreme net short positioning simultaneously, that tells you something about broad institutional sentiment on interest rates.
It provides context. A 10,000-contract move in gold means different things depending on whether net positioning is at the 5th percentile or the 95th percentile of its historical range.
The COT report is not a timing tool. It does not tell you when to enter or exit a position. It is a positioning tool — it tells you where institutional money sits, and that context makes other analysis more informed.
Common Misconceptions
"Extreme positioning always leads to reversals"
Sometimes it does. Sometimes extreme positioning just gets more extreme. The COT report can remain at percentile extremes for weeks or months before anything happens. Treat it as a risk indicator, not a signal.
"Commercials are always right"
Commercials are hedging. Their "rightness" is incidental to their purpose. A mining company selling gold futures at $2,000 doesn't care if gold goes to $2,500 — they locked in a price they're happy with. Interpreting their positioning as a directional call is a category error.
"The 3-day lag makes the data useless"
The lag matters less than you think for longer-term positioning analysis. Institutional positions are built over weeks, not hours. A 200,000-contract net long in crude oil doesn't vanish by Friday.
"The COT report is a trading system"
It is not. It is one input among many. People who use COT data effectively combine it with price action, technical analysis, or fundamental research. The data provides context, not entry tickets.
Legacy vs. Disaggregated: Which Should You Use?
Start with Legacy. It's simpler, has a longer history, and the Commercial/Non-Commercial split captures the essential dynamic: hedgers vs speculators.
Move to Disaggregated when you need to distinguish:
1 Managed Money (hedge funds) from Other Reportables (pension funds, insurance companies)
2 Producers/Merchants (physical market participants) from Swap Dealers (banks running swap books)
For most markets and most purposes, the Legacy report gives you 90% of the insight. We use the Legacy format across our analysis. See our methodology page for details.
How We Use COT Data on This Site
We pull data directly from the CFTC's public API every week. Our analysis adds three layers on top of the raw numbers:
1 Percentile rankings — where current positioning sits relative to the past 2 years of data. A 95th percentile reading means positioning is more extreme than 95% of the prior 104 weeks. See full methodology.
2 Week-over-week changes — which markets had the biggest positioning shifts this week.
3 Z-scores — how many standard deviations current positioning is from the historical mean.
All of this is available on the dashboard and discussed each week in our blog analysis.
The raw data is also downloadable as JSON: cot-latest.json.

учета позиций:
Контракт – 5‑летний, cash‑settled фьючерс с «perpetual‑style» механикой, но с
формальной дальней датой экспирации (типа декабрь 2030.
Номинал: 1 контракт = 1/100 BTC 0.01 BTC, расчеты и маржа в USD.
Цена котируется в USD за 1 BTC, минимальный тик 0.05 USD за контракт.
Для отчета: PnL, маржа и комиссии всегда в USD, а не в BTC, номинал позиции удобно
выражать и в контрактах, и в эквиваленте BTC (контракты × 0.01).
Контракт «перпетчул‑стайл»: нет регулярного ролла, позиция может держаться весь
срок, но используется funding‑механизм для привязки к spot.
Funding начисляется на открытые позиции с определенным шагом (в спецификации
Coinbase – аккумулируется ежечасно и клирингом списывается/зачисляется 2 раза в
день).
Эти списания/начисления проходят через отдельные «cash adjustment» события, не
меняя цену входа, а двигая денежный баланс счета.
В отчетах funding логично выделять отдельной строкой (аналог своп-процентов):
Trading PnL (по изменению цены фьючерса)
Funding PnL (процентный компонент)
Total PnL  Trading + Funding.
Торгуется практически 24/7, с недельным часовым перерывом (пятница 600 PM

Funding vs variation margin
В классических регуляторных фьючах PnL идет только через variation margin, нет
funding‑ставок против индекса.
В nano Bitcoin Perp Style variation margin + funding‑коррекции существуют
одновременно: variation margin отражает чистое движение фьюча, funding – «перенос»

В отчете это важно делить, чтобы понимать, что часть дохода/расхода – это
«стоимость финансирования» позиции.

Данные Disaggregated COT (tradingster, май 2025, Code 133LM1 — Nano BTC legacy,
аналогичная структура):
Leveraged Funds (хедж-фонды, CTA: доминируют в шортах 45.9% OI), лонг-
позиция минимальна 0.8%. Это типичные алго-фонды и CTA, которые используют
nano-контракты для точного управления экспозицией и арбитражных стратегий.
Other Reportables: крупнейшая категория в лонгах 89.3% OI). Сюда попадают retail-
ориентированные брокерские агрегаторы, prop-торговые столы, небольшие фонды,
которые не относятся к классическим категориям.
Non-Reportable (мелкие трейдеры): 812% OI по лонгам, 2% по шортам —
классические retail-участники ниже порога отчетности CFTC.
Dealer/Asset Manager: 0 позиций. Институциональные asset managers и дилеры не
используют этот продукт — они работают с CME BTC фьючами или ETF.
Асимметрия лонг/шорт по категориям — это главный сигнал:
Leveraged Funds (умные деньги / CTA стоят в нетто-шорт — используют perp-style
для хеджирования спот/ETFлонгов или спред-стратегий.
Other Reportables доминируют в нетто-лонг — это и есть основная «розничная толпа»
с более высоким чеком.
Чем сильнее расхождение между этими двумя категориями, тем интереснее сигнал
разворота.
Отсутствие Commercials означает, что стандартный подход «следи за commercials как за
smart money» здесь не работает. В nano BTC perp роль «информированного хеджера»
выполняют Leveraged Funds.
Малое количество шорт-трейдеров 79 человек против 268 лонговых) при 97.8% шорт OI

⁂ Тут не понял, я думал что нужно следить именно за lavarage fund так как у них есть
спекулятивный интерес. Например на евро, это не так ?
Отличный вопрос — ты абсолютно прав, и тут нужно разграничить два совершенно
разных подхода в зависимости от типа рынка и типа отчёта COT.
Логика «следи за commercials как за smart money» работает только на товарных рынках
(нефть, зерно, золото, серебро) — потому что там коммерциалы — это реальные
производители и хеджеры с инсайдерским знанием физического рынка. На финансовых
фьючерсах (евро, S&P, bitcoin) эта логика не применима — там коммерциалы это дилеры
и банки, которые хеджируют операционные книги, а не делают направленные ставки.
Для EURфьючерсов (и любых валют) нужно использовать TFFотчёт (Traders in Financial
Futures), а не Legacy COT. В нём ключевая категория именно Leveraged Funds — это
хедж-фонды и CTA с направленными ставками на курс. Когда они масштабно набирают
нетто-лонг по евро — это реальный институциональный сигнал роста, а не хедж.
Самый мощный сигнал — «переполненная сделка» (overcrowded trade): когда Leveraged
Funds в евро находятся на 9095м перцентиле нетто-лонга, новых покупателей уже нет, и
риск разворота резко возрастает. Также отслеживается «флип» — переход с нетто-лонга
в нетто-шорт — как сигнал смены тренда на несколько недель.

Это подтверждено академически: исследование 2022 года по CME Bitcoin futures
показало, что Leveraged Funds демонстрируют устойчивую market timing ability — в
первую очередь через управление короткими позициями, а другие категории участников
следуют за ними с задержкой. Именно поэтому в Nano BTC Perp Style (где Commercials =
0 Leveraged Funds выполняют роль «информированной» категории по умолчанию, и их
нетто-позиция / флип — это главный сигнал в этом отчёте.
Таким образом, твоя изначальная интуиция про Leveraged Funds верна — просто на
товарных рынках их «перебивают» Commercials с ещё более сильным сигналом.

❌ Ошибка в прошлом ответе: я написал, что для Legacy COT «Commercials = smart money»
на товарах. Это неточная формулировка. Правильно: в Legacy COT категория
Commercials включает в себя и Production/Merchant/Processor, и Swap Dealers вместе —
это искажает сигнал. Именно поэтому для серьёзного анализа нужно использовать
Disaggregated COT, где эти две группы разделены, и смотреть только на
Producer/Merchant/Processor/User без swap dealers.
✅ Подтверждено: Leveraged Funds в TFF — это официальное определение CFTC хедж-
фонды, CTA (commodity trading advisors), CPO (commodity pool operators) и аналогичные
структуры, которые занимаются направленными спекулятивными позициями и
арбитражем. Именно поэтому для финансовых инструментов (валюты, индексы, BTC) —
это и есть главная категория для анализа.
✅ Подтверждено: TFFотчёт делит рынок на sell-side Dealer/Intermediary) и buy-side
Asset Managers, Leveraged Funds, Other Reportables). Leveraged Funds — buy-side с
наибольшим спекулятивным компонентом.
На CME Bitcoin в категорию Other Reportables попадают компании с прямой операционной
экспозицией к BTC  Coinbase, Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy — которые
хеджируют реальную крипто-экспозицию. Это делает их частично аналогом
«Commercials» в товарных рынках. Поэтому для CME Bitcoin полезно смотреть и на
Leveraged Funds, и на Other Reportables одновременно.
Для Nano BTC Perp Style этих игроков нет — контракт слишком нишевый и мелкий для
корпоративного хеджирования, и вся значимая активность сосредоточена исключительно
в Leveraged Funds.

окей, теперь поищи еще нишевые обьяснения того как использовать корректно данные СОТ

Сырые числа позиций сами по себе ничего не говорят, потому что у каждого рынка разный
масштаб OI. Профессиональный подход — нормировать позицию через COT Index
(перцентиль): берётся исторический ряд нетто-позиции за lookback period (стандарт — 3
года / 156 недель), и текущее значение ранжируется от 0% до 100%.
Зоны для принятия решений:
Перцентиль Зона Сигнал
05% Extreme Low Экстремально низкая нетто-позиция (потенциальный разворот вверх)
525% Below Average Слабое позиционирование
2575% Mid-Range Нет значимого сигнала
7595% Above Average Тяжёлое позиционирование
95100% Extreme High Экстремально высокая нетто-позиция (потенциальный разворот вниз)
Важно: lookback period критически влияет на результат. При 3летнем окне бычьи рынки
будут давать постоянно высокие значения и ложные сигналы. При 6месячном окне —
слишком много шума. Оптимальный подход — использовать два окна параллельно 3
года и 1 год) и искать совпадение экстремумов.
Нишевая техника: вместо абсолютного уровня нетто-позиции анализировать
еженедельное изменение позиции (delta week-over-week). Особенно ценны:
Аномальные изменения — резкий сброс лонгов Leveraged Funds за 12 недели на
фоне растущей цены = скрытое распределение
Дивергенция цена vs позиция: цена делает новый хай, а нетто-позиция крупных
спекулянтов—нет→медвежьядивергенция
Дивергенция между категориями: цена растёт, Leveraged Funds сокращают лонги, а
OtherReportables—наращивают→сменарукотумныхктолпе
Одна из самых нишевых и недооценённых техник — не анализировать позиции отдельно
от Open Interest. Правило:
ЭкстремумпозицииLeveragedFundsприпадающемOI→слабыйсигнал(ликвидация,
а не новый импульс)
ЭкстремумпозицииприрастущемOI→сильныйсигнал(новыеучастникивходятв

CFTC публикует в отчёте долю позиций, приходящуюся на топ4 и топ8 трейдеров в
каждой категории. Это нишевая и мощная метрика:
Если 4 трейдера держат 80% шортов Leveraged Funds — это не рыночный
консенсус, а позиция одного-двух крупных фондов, и при их закрытии возможен
резкий short squeeze
Для Nano BTC Perp Style этот показатель особенно важен, т.к. там всего 79 трейдеров
в шорте при 97.8% OI — концентрация почти наверняка аномальная
Даже на товарных рынках есть нишевое уточнение: не каждый экстремум Commercials
работает. Ключевой фильтр — сезонность: commercials в агро-рынках всегда резко
увеличивают хеджирование перед урожаем, и это создаёт ложные экстремумы COT
индекса каждый год. Для исключения этого эффекта используется сезонно-
скорректированный COTиндекс — сравнение текущей позиции с позицией в
аналогичную неделю предыдущих лет, а не просто rolling window.
COT публикуется в пятницу за состояние на вторник — задержка 3 дня. Практические
подходы к компенсации:
Использовать COT только как фильтр направления, а не как таймер входа — вход по
техническим сигналам (Price Action, уровни)
Сравнивать данные с движением рынка вторник–пятница: если рынок уже сильно
сдвинулся в сторону позиции, данные уже «отыграны»
Наиболее актуальны данные COT в боковых рынках — в трендовых они запаздывают
критически
Переход Leveraged Funds с нетто-лонга в нетто-шорт (или наоборот) — «flip» —
исторически один из наиболее надёжных среднесрочных сигналов (горизонт 38 недель).
Для Bitcoin и валют это важнее абсолютного уровня позиции, потому что устраняет
проблему выбора lookback period. Flip — это объективное событие, независимое от
нормировки.

Нашёл крайне ценный материал — включая детали из академических исследований и
нишевые техники от профессиональных трейдеров. Вот расширенный разбор.
Три ключевых исследования, на которые ссылаются профи:
Bessembinder & Chan 1992 — доказали статистически значимую прогнозирующую
способность Commercial хеджеров на товарных рынках, особенно на экстремумах
позиций
Sanders, Boris & Manfredo 2004 — показали, что крупные спекулянты (Leveraged
Funds / Managed Money) — поздние тренд-фолловеры, которые достигают
максимума позиции именно у конца тренда, а не у его начала
Wang 2003 — показал, что позиция мелких трейдеров имеет отрицательную
корреляцию с последующей доходностью, то есть они — надёжный контр-индикатор
Важная оговорка: прогнозирующая сила commercials значительно сильнее на физических
товарах (агро, энергоносители, металлы), где реальная информационная асимметрия
максимальна. На финансовых фьючерсах (валюты, индексы, BTC) эти эффекты слабее.
Это вторая производная позиции — скорость изменения скорости наращивания позиции.
Когда Leveraged Funds активно добавляют лонги несколько недель подряд, но темп
набора позиции начинает замедляться — это ранний сигнал разворота за 13 недели до
реального флипа. Стандартный COTIndex этого не покажет, нужно считать
дополнительно.
Нетто-позиция в абсолюте ничего не стоит без нормировки на общий Open Interest.
Формула:
к а т е г ория
Если Leveraged Funds держат нетто-шорт = 30% от всего OI — это уже системно
значимая позиция, способная двигать рынок при закрытии
Если та же нетто-позиция в абсолюте = всего 5% OI — сигнал слабый, даже если
перцентиль высокий
поищи еще, это была очень полезная информация

Это разница между нормированным COTиндексом Commercials и Leveraged Funds.
Логика:
Ситуация Что означает
Commercials на экстремуме шорта (индекс < 10,
Leveraged Funds на экстремуме лонга (индекс > 90
Максимальный divergence — исторически
предшествует резким разворотам, «crowded trade»
Оба движутся в одном направлении Нет сигнала, рынок в балансе
Commercials сокращают шорты, Leveraged Funds всё
ещё добавляют лонги
Ранний сигнал: умные деньги начинают выходить,
толпа ещё входит
Wang 2003 показал, что именно эти высоко-дивергентные среды предшествуют
максимальной волатильности и разворотам.
Это нишевое понимание поведения Leveraged Funds: они не предсказывают тренд, они
его усиливают. Практически это значит:
Смотреть на их рост позиции как на подтверждение входа, а не как на опережающий
индикатор
Использовать их экстремумы как сигнал выхода из трендовых позиций или для
наращивания хеджа
Никогда не использовать максимум их позиции для открытия нового трендового
входа — это ловушка
CFTC публикует долю позиций топ4 и топ8 трейдеров в каждой категории (Long Format
отчёт). Нишевая интерпретация:
Высокая концентрация + экстремум позиции = позиция 12 игроков, а не рыночный
консенсус→сигналменеенадёжен
Низкая концентрация + экстремум = позиция разделена между десятками
участников→сигналзначительнонадёжнее,этоистинныйконсенсусрынка
Рост концентрации при снижении OI — признак накопления одним игроком,
потенциально манипулятивная активность
Профессиональный подход — не торговать сигналы в изоляции, а использовать COT как
режимный фильтр для существующей системы. Пример:
$Когда COTиндекс Leveraged Funds > 85% (экстремальный лонг) → уменьшить $
размер позиции на 50% для новых трендовых входов вверх

$Когда COTиндекс Commercials < 10% → ужесточить стопы на лонгах $
Когда все три группы на экстремумах одновременно (commercials шортят, спекулянты
лонгуют,retailвFOMO)→максимальныйрискразворота,новыелонгизакрыть
Оптимальная методология — три параллельных окна одновременно, а не одно:
Окно Период Для чего
Короткое 52 недели 1 год) Тактические экстремумы, краткосрочные сигналы
Среднее 156 недель 3 года) Основной рабочий сигнал
Длинное 252520 недель 510 лет) Фильтр структурных режимов, устранение secular bias
Сигнал считается сильным только если совпадает хотя бы в двух из трёх окон.
Одиночный экстремум в одном окне — слабый сигнал.
Когда рынок входит в структурный бычий рынок (например, золото в 20202024 или BTC
в 20202021, Commercials могут находиться в зоне экстремального шорта месяцами, а
цена продолжает расти. Это не сломанный сигнал — это именно то, что они делают:
хеджируют производство по «высоким» ценам. Поэтому COT в чистом виде не работает
против мощных макро-драйверов и всегда требует совмещения с более широким
фундаментальным контекстом.
